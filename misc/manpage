.SH 1. GETTING HELP
There are several ways of getting help in \fBclifm\fR. Once in the program, enter '\fB?\fR' to see some basic usage examples, or press \fBF1\fR to access this manpage, \fBF2\fR to go to the \fBCOMMANDS\fR section of this very manpage, or \fBF3\fR to go to the \fBKEYBOARD SHORTCUTS\fR section.
.sp
To get help about some specific topic, type \fIhelp\fR and then press TAB to get a list of available help topics. Choose the topic you want and then just press Enter.
.sp
Help for all internal commands can be accessed via the \fI-h\fR or \fI--help\fR options. For example, \fIs -h\fR or \fIs --help\fR.
.sp
A convenient way of getting full information about \fBclifm\fR commands is via the '\fBih\fR' action, bound by default to the interactive help plugin (\fIihelp.sh\fR). Just type 'ih' to run the plugin (it depends on \fIFZF\fR) and select the command you want to obtain information about.
.sp
For a quick introduction jump to the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section at the bottom of this document.

.SH 2. DESCRIPTION
\fBClifm\fR is a \fBC\fRommand \fBL\fRine \fBI\fRnterface \fBF\fRile \fBM\fRanager. This is its main feature and strength: all input and interacion is performed via commands typed in a prompt. In other words, \fBclifm\fR is a REPL, since it's basic structure is simply this: \fBR\fRead (user input via a command line), \fBE\fRvaluate/\fBE\fRxecute the command, \fBP\fRrint the results, \fBL\fRoop (start all over again).
.sp
Unlike most terminal file managers out there, indeed, \fBclifm\fR replaces the traditional TUI interface (also known as curses or text-menu based interface) by a simple command-line interface (REPL). In this sense, it is a file manager, but also \fBa shell extension\fR: search for files, copy, rename, and trash some of them, but, at the same time, update/upgrade your system, add some cronjob, stop a service, and run nano (or vi, or emacs, if you like).
.sp
Simply put, with \fBclifm\fR the command-line is still there, never hidden, but enriched with file management oriented functionalities.

.SH 3. FEATURES
\fBClifm\fR is a completely text\-based, \fBshell\-like\fR file manager for the terminal able to perform all the basic operations you may expect from any other FM. However, its most distinguishing characteristics are:
.sp
  \fBa)\fR An extensive and customizable list of \fBcolor codes\fR to easily identify file types and extensions.
.sp
  \fBb)\fR The use of \fBshort (and even one\-character) commands\fR, and \fBentry list numbers (ELN's)\fR instead of file names. Enter \fIo\ 12\fR, for instance, to open a file with your default text editor or to change to the desired directory. If the \fBautocd\fR and \fBauto-open\fR functions are enabled, which is the default (see below the \fIacd\fR and \fIao\fR commands), you only need to enter the ELN to open the file or change to directory: instead of \fIo\ 12\fR, just enter \fI12\fR.
.sp
With the \fBautomatic ELN expansion\fR feature you can use ELN's with external commands as well. \fIdiff\ 12\ 5\fR, for example, will run \fBdiff\fR(1) over the files corresponding to ELN's 12 and 5. \fBRanges\fR are also accepted, for example: \fIrm\ 1\-12\fR or \fIr\ 1\-12\fR. Since numbers could be a bit tricky when it comes to listed files, \fBTAB completion\fR is available for ELN's and ELN ranges, just as for many other things (see the \fBBUILT-IN EXPANSIONS\fR section below). \fIGemini\fR, a powerful \fBauto-suggestions\fR system (heavily inspired by the Fish shell), was developed with this very purpose in mind.
.sp
  \fBc)\fR \fBAutomatic files listing\fR: Unlike the shell \fBcd\fR command, \fBclifm\fR's built\-in \fIcd\fR function automatically lists files in the new directory.
.sp
  \fBd)\fR \fBSeveral shell capabilities: Fish\-like auto\-suggestions\fR that, together with TAB completion, syntax highlighting, and history (for both commands and visited directories) assists the user when it comes to typing commands. This feature includes a warning prompt to warn the user when typing an invalid command name.
.sp
  \fBe)\fR \fBBookmarks\fR: keep a list of your favorite directories, and even files, to get easy access to them. Example: enter \fIbm\fR (or press Alt\-b) to open the bookmarks screen and then simply type a number or a shortcut name to access the desired bookmark.
.sp
  \fBf)\fR The \fBSelection Box\fR allows you to drop files and directories from different parts of the file system (even from different instances of \fBclifm\fR) and then operate on them with just one command. Example: select a few files in one instance of the program (say \fIs\ 12;\ cd\ /media;\ s\ 2\ 5\-6\fR) and then paste them somewhere else using a second instance (\fIv\ sel\fR, \fIpaste\ sel\fR or Ctrl-Alt-v). Both wildcards (globbing) and regular expressions are supported. Inverse matching is also allowed for patterns.
.sp
  \fBg)\fR The \fBdirectory history\fR function (\fIback\fR and \fIforth\fR) keeps track of all visited directories, so that you can go back and forth to any of them by just entering \fIb\fR or \fIf\fR (or just pressing Alt\-j and Alt\-k, or Shift\-Left and Shift\-Right, respectively). Another way of quickly navigating through visited directories is using \fIKangaroo\fR, a built-in \fBdirectory jumper\fR function. See the \fIj\fR command below.
.sp
  \fBh)\fR An extensive list of \fBkeyboard shortcuts\fR make it even easier and faster to navigate and operate on your files. For example, instead of typing \fIcd\ ..\fR to go back to the parent directory, or \fIs\ *\fR to select all files in the current directory, you can simply press Alt\-u (or Shift\-Up) and Alt\-a respectively.
.sp
  \fBi)\fR The \fBquick search\fR function makes it really easy to quickly find the files you are looking for: just enter a slash followed by the string or regular expression you want (ex: \fI/myfile\fR or \fI/.*\.png\fR), that's all. Inverse search is also allowed by prepending an exclamation mark (!) to the search pattern.
.sp
  \fBj)\fR \fBPlugins\fR: Build your own custom commands using executable files (shell scripts or binaries). Just drop an executable file (all languages are supported) in the plugins directory, tell \fBclifm\fR to use this executable file via a custom action name, and use it as any other command.
.sp
  \fBk)\fR \fBFiles preview\fR: Via the \fIfzfnav\fR plugin (see the \fBPLUGINS\fR section below), \fBclifm\fR is able to preview several kinds of files, including not only text files, but also GIF's, images, office documents, PDF's, and more. This plugin requires \fIFZF\fR to be installed. For basic images preview \fIueberzug\fR is required. A list of optional dependencies to preview different kinds of files is available in the \fBPLUGINS\fR section.
.sp
  \fBl)\fR It is blazing \fBfast\fR and incredibly \fBlightweight\fR. With a memory footprint below 5 MiB and a disk usage of 0.5 MiB, it can run on really ancient hardware. It is so simple that it doesn't require an X session nor any graphical environment at all, being able thus to perfectly run on the console (TTY) and even on a headless machine via a SSH or any other remote session. And if this is not enough, you can still try the \fBlight mode\fR to make it even faster.
.sp
  \fBm)\fR When running in \fBstealth mode\fR, it will leave not trace at all on the host system.
.sp
Because inspired by the \fBKISS\fR principle, \fBclifm\fR is fundamentally aimed to be lightweight, fast, simple, and efficient. On Archlinux's notion of simplicity see: \fIhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Simplicity\fR

.SH 4. PARAMETERS
.SH POSITIONAL PARAMETERS
.TP
If the first non\-option parameter is a directory, \fBclifm\fR will start in this directory. Otherwise, if not a directory, it will open the file via the default associated application and exit (working thus as a stand-alone resource opener). URL's and the URI file scheme (for local file systems) is supported.
.TP
For example, by running 'clifm /etc/hosts', the \fIhosts\fR file will be opened and \fBclifm\fR will immediately exit. In the same way \fIclifm\ https://some_domain\fR will open this web resource with the application associated to the \fItext/html\fR MIME type.
.TP
On the other side, the command \fIclifm\ /etc\fR instructs \fBclifm\fR to start in the directory \fI/etc\fR. If not specified, the first workspace will be used. To start in a different workspace use the \fI\-w\fR option. For instance: \fIclifm\ \-w4\ /etc\fR.

no case\-sensitive files listing (default)
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-case\-sensitive\fR
case\-sensitive files listing
.TP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keybindings\-file\fR=\fI\,FILE\/\fR
set an alternative keybindings file
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-no\-long\-view\fR
disable long view mode (default)
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-long\-view\fR
enable long view mode to list files and their properties. For each file, the following information is provided: file name, file permissions (symbolic notation), owner, group, last modification time, and size (these fields could be turned on/off using the \fIPropFields\fR option in the configuration file). To get more detailed information use the \fIp\fR command (see below).
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-dirhist\-map\fR
enable the directory history map to keep in view previous, current and next entries in the directory history list
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-no\-autols\fR
\fIcd\fR works like the shell \fIcd\fR command: change directory but do not list files automatically
.TP
\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-\-autols\fR
\fIcd\fR changes directory and lists files automatically (default)
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-path\fR=\fI\,PATH\/\fR
use \fIPATH\fR as \fBclifm\fR starting path. Default starting path is the current working directory. If no workspace is specified via the \fB--workspace\fR option (see below), the first workspace (1) is used. This option is deprecated: use positional parameters instead.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-profile\fR=\fI\,PROFILE\/\fR
use \fIPROFILE\fR as profile. If \fIPROFILE\fR does not exist, it will be created. Default profile is 'default'

.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-splash\fR
enable the splash screen
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-stealth-mode\fR
leave no trace on the host system. Nothing is read from files nor any file is created: all settings are set to the default value. However, most settings can still be controlled via command line options. Listing colors could be customized via dedicated environment variables (see the \fBENVIRONMENT\fR section below). Take a look as well to the \fIhistory\fR command and the \fI--no-history\fR command line switch.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-disk\-usage\-analyzer\fR
run in disk usage analyzer mode. Equivalent to \fI--sort=size --long-view --full-dir-size --no-dirs-first --apparent-size\fR. The total size of the current directory, plus the name and size of the largest file will be printed after the list of files. Sizes are calculated using actual device usage (rather than apparent size) in powers of 1024 (KiB, MiB, etc). To use apparent sizes instead add the \fI--apparent-size\fR switch. Press Ctrl-Alt-i (or Alt-TAB) to toggle this mode on/off in-place.
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-no\-unicode\fR
disable unicode
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-unicode\fR
enable unicode to correctly list file names containing accents, tildes, umlauts, non\-latin letters, etc. This option is enabled by default.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
show version details and exit
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-workspace\fR=\fI\,NUM\/\fR
start in workspace \fINUM\fR. By default, \fBclifm\fR will recover the last visited directory for each workspace. However, you can override this behaviour using positional parameters, as described above, to start in workspace \fINUM\fR and in path \fIPATH\fR.
.TP
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-\-no\-toggle\-workspaces\fR
workspace keybindings (by default Alt\-[1\-4]) do not toggle current and previous workspaces
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-no\-ext\-cmds\fR
disallow the use of external, shell commands
.TP
\fB\-y\fR, \fB\-\-light\-mode\fR

.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-sort\fR=\fI\,METHOD\/\fR
sort files by \fIMETHOD\fB, where \fIMETHOD\fR could be one of: 0 = none, 1 = name, 2 = size, 3 = atime, 4 = btime (ctime if not available), 5 = ctime, 6 = mtime, 7 = version (name if not available), 8 =  extension, 9 = inode, 10 = owner, 11 = group. Both numbers and strings are allowed. E.g: --sort=9, --sort=inode.
.TP
\fB\-\-apparent\-size\fR
use apparent sizes instead of actual device usage
.TP
\fB\-\-bell\fR=\fI\,TYPE\/\fR
Choose the terminal bell type, where TYPE could be: 0 = none, 1 = audible, 2 = visual (requires readline >= 8.1), 3 = flash. Defaults to 'visible', and, if not possible, 'none'.
.TP
\fB\-\-case\-sens\-dirjump\fR
do not ignore case when consulting the jump database (via the \fIj\fR command)
.TP
\fB\-\-case\-sens\-path\-comp\fR
enable case sensitive path completion
.TP
\fB\-\-cd\-on\-quit\fR
write last visited directory to \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/.last\fR to be later accessed by the corresponding shell function at program exit. See the \fBSHELL FUNCTIONS\fR section below.
.TP
\fB\-\-color\-scheme\fR=\fI\,NAME\/\fR
set \fINAME\fR as color scheme
.TP
\fB\-\-cwd\-in\-title\fR

\fB\-\-enable\-logs\fR
enable program logs. See the \fIlog\fR command for more information
.TP
\fB\-\-expand\-bookmarks\fR
expand bookmark names into the corresponding bookmark paths and enable TAB completion for bookmark names as well. If the bookmark is, .e.g. mybookmark=/my/path, "mybo" will be completed as "mybookmark", which will be interpreted then as "/my/path"
.TP
\fB\-\-fzytab\fR
use \fIfzy\fR to display completion matches
.TP
\fB\-\-full\-dir\-size\fR
if running in long view, print directories size and their contents
.TP

enable fuzzy matches for completions and suggestions (only file names and paths)
.TP
\fB\-\-icons\fR
enable icons
.TP
\fB\-\-icons\-use\-file\-color\fR
instead of an specific color, icons take the color of the corresponding file name (specified either via file type or via file extension). Useful when building custom color schemes. This option implies \fB--icons\fR. Only if compiled with support for either icons-in-terminal or Nerdfonts. The default build is compiled with emoji-icons support, in which case this option is ignored (Unicode icons has their own color built-in)
.TP
\fB\-\-list\-and\-quit\fR
list files and quit. It may be used in conjunction parameter substitution. Ex: 'clifm --list-and-quit /etc'
.TP
\fB\-\-mnt\-udisks2\fR

\fB\-\-max\-path\fR=\fI\,NUM\/\fR
set the maximum number of characters after which the current directory in the prompt line will be abbreviated to the directory base name (if \\z is used in the prompt)
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-cd\-auto\fR
by default, \fBclifm\fR changes to directories by just specifying the corresponding ELN (e.g. '12' instead of 'cd 12'). This option forces the use of \fIcd\fR
.TP
\fB\-\-no-control\-d\-exit\fR
do not allow exit on EOF (Control-d)
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-dir\-jumper\fR
disable the directory jumper function
.TP
\fB\-\-no-classify\fR
by default, \fBclifm\fR appends a file type indicator character to file names when running with no colors (see the \fB--no-color\fR option below) and both a directory indicator and a files counter for directories when running with colors. Classification characters are: 
 /n: directories (n = files counter)
 @: symbolic links
 |: fifo/pipes
 =: sockets
 *: executable files
 ?: unknown file type
Use this option to disable file type classification.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-clear\-screen\fR

same as no-cd-auto, but for files instead of directories
.TP
\fB\-\-no-refresh\-on\-resize\fR
do not attempt to refresh the list of files upon window's resize
.TP
\fB\-\-no-restore\-last\-path\fR
by default, \fBclifm\fR saves the last visited directory for each workspace to be restored in the next session. Use this option to disable this behavior.
.TP
\fB\-\-no-suggestions\fR
disable the auto-suggestions system
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-tips\fR
disable startup tips
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-warning\-prompt\fR

specify a resource opener to use. If \fIopener\fR is not set, \fILira\fR will be used instead
.TP
\fB\-\-print\-sel\fR
always print the list of selected files. Since this list could be quite extensive, the maximum number of selected files to print could be specified via the \fBMaxPrintSelfiles\fR option in the configuration file. Defaults to 0 (auto, i.e. never take more than half terminal height). Use -1 to remove the limit or any other positive value.
.TP
\fB\-\-rl\-vi\-mode\fR

Help for all commands listed here can be accessed via the \fI-h\fR or \fI--help\fR options.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fR ELN = Entry List Number. Example: in the line "12 openbox" (when listing files), 12 is the ELN corresponding to the file named "openbox". The slash followed by a number (/xx) after directories and symbolic links to directories (the files counter) indicates the amount of files contained by the corresponding directory, excluding self and parent directories ("." and ".." Respectively).
.sp
\fBNOTE 2:\fR In case of ELN-filename conflict the backslash can be used to prevent ELN expansion. For example, if we have at least two files and one of them in named "2", then \fBclifm\fR cannot know in advance if the command refers to the ELN 2 or to the file name "2". In we want the ELN, we just write the ELN number, for example: \fIs\ 2\fR. But if we want the file name, we need to escape the file name using the backlash character: \fIs\ \\2\fR.
.sp
\fBNOTE 3:\fR \fBclifm\fR supports \fBfused parameters\fR for internal commands taking an ELN or range of ELN's as parameters. Much like short options for command line programs, you can drop or omit the space between internal commands and the corresponding ELN passed as argument. In general, you can write \fICMDELN\fR instead of \fICMD\ ELN\fR. For example: \fIo12\fR or \fIs1\-5\fR instead of \fIo\ 12\fR and \fIs\ 1\-5\fR respectively. Bear in mind, however, that in thus omitting the space char TAB completion for ELN's won't be available. If there is a file named \fIo12\fR (more generally, CMDELN), and if you want to refer to this file instead of a \fBclifm\fR command, escape the file name to prevent the split; for example: \fIs\ \\o12\fR.
.sp
\fBNOTE 4:\fR \fBclifm\fR implements a \fBfastback\fR function, that is to say, the conversion of "... n" or "cmd ... n" into "../.. n" or "cmd ../.. n". In other words, subsequent dots after ".." will be converted each into "/..". For example, if you are in your home directory and type "..." or "cd ...", and since "..." amounts to "../..", you will be taken to the root directory. TAB completion is available for the fastback function: "....bin" -> TAB -> "../../../bin".

.TP
.B \fIFILE/DIR\fR
if the \fIautocd\fR and \fIauto-open\fR functions are enabled, which is the default value, open FILE or change directory to DIR. In other words, \fIFILE\fR amounts to \fIopen\ FILE\fR or \fIo\ FILE\fR, and \fIDIR\fR to \fIcd\ DIR\fR. ELN's, of course, are allowed. Example: \fI12\fR.
.TP
.B /\fIPATTERN\fR [\fI\-filetype\fR] [\fI-x\fR] [\fIDIR\fR]
this is the quick search function. Just type \fI/\fR followed by a glob or regular (or extended regular) expression, and \fBclifm\fR will list all matches in the current working directory. For example, both \fI/*.pdf\fR and \fI/.pdf$\fR expressions will list all PDF files in the current working directory, the former using wildcards, and the second a regular expression.
.sp
\fBNote\fR: By default, the search function attempts to resolve a pattern first as glob, and if no matches, as regular expression. This behavior can be customizad in the configuration file, via the \fISearchStrategy\fR option.
.sp
\fBNote 2\fR: If no further parameter is provided, but only a glob pattern (wildcards), you can expand the pattern into the corresponding matches via the TAB key. For example, to list all C files in the current directory: \fI/*.c\fR<TAB>.
.sp
Expressions containing no pattern metacharacter are automatically transformed into a glob/regular expression (depending on the value of the \fISearchStrategy\fR option). For example, \fI/test\fR becomes \fI*test*\fR or \fI/.*test.*\fR.
.sp
By default, regular expressions are case insensitive (glob expressions, by contrast, are always case sensitive). However, you can enable case sensitive search by setting the \fICaseSensitiveSearch\fR option to true in the configuration file.
.sp
To search for files in any directory other than the current directory, specify the directory name as a further parameter. This parameter (DIR) could be an absolute path, a relative path, or an ELN. For example, enter \fI/^A\ 7\fR to search for all files starting with 'A' in the directory corresponding to the ELN 7.
.sp
The result of the search could be further filtered by specifying a filter type: \-b, \-c, \-d, \-f, \-l, \-p, and \-s (block device, character device, directory, regular file, symbolic link, FIFO/pipe, and socket respectively. For example, \fI/[.-].*d$\ \-d Documents/\fR will list all directories containing a dot or a dash and ending with 'd' in the directory named \fIDocuments\fR.
.sp
The quick search function also supports invert search: prepend the exclamation mark (!) to negate a given search pattern. For example: \fI!.*s$\ -d\ /etc\fR will match all directories in \fI/etc\fR NOT ending with 's', just as \fI!D*\fR will match all files in the current directory NOT starting with 'D'.
.sp
To perform a recursive search use the -x parameter, and, optionally, a search path (DIR) (file type filter is not allowed). The search will be performed using \fIfind\fR as follows: \fIfind\ DIR\ -name\ PATTERN\fR. If no search path is provided, the search is executed starting in the current directory. Otherwise, the search starts in DIR.
.TP
.B ;\fR[\fICMD\fR], \fB:\fR[\fICMD\fR]
If no CMD, run the system shell in the current working directory. If CMD is specified, skip all \fBclifm\fR expansions (see the \fBBUILT\-IN EXPANSIONS\fR section below) and run the input string (CMD) as is via the default system shell.
.TP
.B ac, ad \fIELN/FILE\fR...
archive/compress and dearchive/decompress one or multiple files and/or directories. The archiver function brings two modes: \fIac\fR, to generate archives or compressed files, and \fIad\fR, to decompress or dearchive files, either just listing, extracting, recompressing, or mounting their content. In this latter case, the mountpoint used automatically is \fI$HOME/.config/clifm/PROFILE/mounts/ARCHIVE_NAME\fR.
.sp
The function accepts single and multiple file names, wildcards, ELN ranges, and the 'sel' keyword. For example: \fIac\ sel\fR, \fIac\ 4\-25\ myfile\fR, or \fIad\ *.tar.gz\fR. Multiple archive/compression formats are supported, including Zstandard. When it comes to ISO 9660 files only single files are supported.
.sp
The archive mount function for non ISO files depends on \fBarchivemount\fR, while the remaining functions depend on \fBatool\fR and other third\-party utilities for achive formats support, for example, \fBp7zip\fR. \fBp7zip\fR is also used to manage most decompressing options for ISO 9660 files, except for mount, in which case \fBmount(8)\fR is used. Creation of ISO files is done via \fBgenisoimage\fR(1). For more information consult \fBatool\fR(1), \fBarchivemount\fR(1), \fBzstd\fR(1), and \fB7z\fR(1).
.TP
.B acd, autocd \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, \fIstatus\fR]
toggle the autocd function on/off. If set to on, \fIDIR\fR amounts to \fIcd\ DIR\fR.
.TP
.B actions \fR[\fIedit\fR [\fIAPP\fR]]
with no argument, lists available custom actions (or plugins). Use the 'edit' option to add, remove or modify custom actions (using APP if specified or the default associated application otherwise). The aim of this function is to allow the user to easily add custom commands and functions to \fBclifm\fR. In other words, the actions function is a plugins capability.
.sp
The general procedure is quite simple: a) bind a custom action name to an executable file written in any language you want, be it a shell or Python script, a C program or whatever you like (using the \fIactions.clifm\fR file located in the configuration directory). Example: "myaction=myscript.sh". b) Now, drop the corresponding script (in our example, myscript.sh) into the plugins directory (see the \fBFILES\fR section below). 3) Once this is done, you can call the script using the custom action name defined before as if it were any other command: run \fImyaction\fR, and myscript.sh will be executed.
.sp
All arguments passed to the action command are passed to the script or program as well (which is run via the system shell).
.sp
The plugins provided with \fBclifm\fR (take a look at the plugins directory) could be used as a starting point to create custom plugins.
.TP
.B alias \fR[\fIimport FILE\fR] [\fIls\fR,\fIlist\fR] [\fINAME\fR]
with no argument (or with \fIls,list\fR parameters), it prints the list of available aliases, if any. To get the description of a specific alias just enter \fIalias\fR followed by the alias name. To write a new alias simply enter \fIedit\fR (or press F10) to open the configuration file and add a line like this: "alias name='command args...'" or "alias name='directory'".
.sp
To import aliases from a file, provided it contains aliases in the specified form, use the \fIimport\fR parameter. Aliases conflicting with some of the internal commands won't be imported.
.sp
However, a neat usage for the alias function is not so much to bind short keys to commands, but to files and directories visited regularly. In this way, it is possible to bind as many files or directories, no matter how deep they are in the file system, to very short strings, even single characters. For example, "alias w='/some/file/deep/in/the/filesystem'. Now, no matter where we are, we can just enter 'w', provided \fIautocd\fR and/or \fIauto-open\fR function is enabled, to access the file or directory we want. Theoretically at least, this procedure could be repeated until the system memory is exhausted.
.sp
To create multiple aliases for files at once, this is the recommended procedure: 1) Select all files you want to alias with the \fIsel\fR function: \fIs\ file1\ file2\ file3\ ...\fR. 2) Export the selected files into a temporary file running \fIexp\ sel\fR; 3) Edit this file to contain only valid alias lines:

 alias a1='file1'
 alias b1='file2'
 alias c1='file3'

NOTE: Make sure alias names do not conflict with other commands, either internal or external. To bypass the conflicts check, performed automatically by the 'alias import' command, you can just edit the aliases file manually (F10).

4) Finally, import this file with the \fIalias\fR function: \fIalias\ import\ tmp_file\fR. Now, you can access any of these files by entering just a few characters: a1, b1, and c1.
.TP
.B ao, auto-open \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, \fIstatus\fR]
toggle the auto-open function on/off. If set to on, \fIFILE\fR amounts to \fIopen\ FILE\fR.
.TP
.B b, back \fR[\fIh\fR, \fIhist\fR] [\fIclear\fR] [\fI!ELN\fR]
unlike \fIcd\ ..\fR, which sends you to the parent directory of the current directory, this command (with no argument) sends you back to the previously visited directory.
.sp
\fBclifm\fR keeps a record of all visited directories. You can see this list by typing \fIb\ hist\fR, \fIb\ h\fR or \fIbh\fR, and you can access any element in this list by simply passing the corresponding ELN in this list to the \fIback\fR command. Example:
        :) > ~ $ bh
        1 /home/user
        2 /etc
        3 /proc
        :) > ~ $ b !3
        :) > /proc $
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fR the line printed in green indicates the current position of the \fIback\fR function in the directory history list.
.sp
Finally, you can also clear this history list by typing \fIb\ clear\fR.
.sp
The best way of navigating the directory history list, however, is via the \fIdirectory jumper\fR function. See the \fIj\fR command below.
.TP
.B bb, bleach \fIELN/FILE\fR...
\fIBleach\fR is a built-in file names cleaner (based on detox [\fIhttps://github.com/dharple/detox\fR]), whose main aim is to rename file names using only safe characters.
Bleach cleans file names up either by removing unsafe (extended-ASCII/Unicode) characters without an ASCII alternative/similar character, or by translating these unsafe characters into an alternative ASCII character based on familiarity/similarity.
.sp
These following simple rules are used to compose clean/safe file names:
    - NUL (\\0) and slash (/) characters are completely disallowed
    - Only characters from the \fBPortable Filename Characters Set\fR (a-zA-Z0-9._-) are allowed
    - { [ ( ) ] } are replaced by a dash (-). Everything else is replaced by an underscore (_)
    - Unicode characters are translated, whenever possible, into an ASCII replacement. Otherwise, they are just ignored. For example, an upper case A with diacritic (accent, umlaut, diaresis, and so on) will be replaced by an ASCII A, but the smiley face emoji will be simply ignored. A few special signs will be translated into text, for instance, the pound sign will be replaced by "_pound_" and the Euro symbol by "EUR". Translations are made via a translation table (cleaner_table.h)
    - File names never start with a dash (-)
    - Files named . and .. are not allowed
    - Append .bleach to one character long file names
    - Do not let a replacement file name start with a dot (hidden) if the original does not
    - Max file name length is NAME_MAX (usually 255)
.sp
Modified file names will be listed on screen asking the user for confirmation, allowing besides to edit (by pressing 'e') the list of modified file names via a text editor.
.sp
If the replacement file name already exists, a dash and a number (starting from 1) will be appended. Ex: file-3.
.TP
.B bd \fR[\fINAME\fR]
\fIbd\fR is the \fBbackdir\fR function: it takes you back to the parent directory matching NAME.
.sp
With no arguments, \fIbd\fR prints a menu with all parent directories relative to the current directory, allowing the user to select an entry. Otherwise, it checks the absolute current directory against the provided query string (NAME): if only one match is found, it automatically changes to that directory; if multiple matches are found, the list of matches is presented to the user in a selection menu. If NAME is a directory name, \fIbd\fR just changes to that directory, be it a parent of the current directory or not.
.sp
TAB completion and suggestions are available for this function.
.sp
\fBExample\fR:
.sp
Provided that the current directory is \fI/home/user/git/repositories/lambda\fR, entering \fIbd git\fR will take you immediatelly to \fI/home/user/git\fR.
.sp
Note that there is no need to type the entire directory name; if the query is unambiguous, only a few characters, and even just one, suffices to match the appropriate directory. In our example, \fIbd g\fR is enough to take you to \fI/home/user/git\fR, just as \fIbd h\fR will take you to \fI/home\fR.
.sp
The query string could match any part of a directory name: \fIbd er\fR, for instance, will take you to \fI/home/user\fR, since it is an unambiguous query.
.TP
.B bl \fIELN/FILE\fR...
Create symbolic links (in the current directory) for each specified file. The user will be asked to enter a specific suffix for the symlinks. If none is specified, the basename of the corresponding file is used.
.TP
.B bm, bookmarks \fR[\fIa\fR, \fIadd PATH\fI] [\fId\fR, \fIdel\fR] [\fIedit\fR] [\fISHORTCUT\fR, \fINAME\fR]
with no argument, open the bookmarks menu. Here you can cd into the desired bookmark by entering either its ELN, its shortcut or its name. In this screen you can also add, remove or edit your bookmarks by simply typing 'e' to edit the bookmarks file (which is simply a list of lines with this format: [shortcut]name:path. Ex: [d]documents:/home/user/documents).
.sp
If you want to add or remove a bookmark directly from the command line, use the 'a' and 'd' arguments respectively. Example: \fIbm\ a\ /media/misc\fR or \fIbm\ d\fR. You can also open a bookmark by typing 'bm shortcut' or \fIbm\ name\fR (in which latter case TAB completion is available).
.sp
A handy use for the bookmarks function, provided the expand-bookmarks option is enabled, is to create bookmarks using short names, which will be later easily accessible via TAB completion.
.sp
To operate on specific bookmark paths, you can use the \fIb:\fR construct (mostly useful if using the FZF mode for TAB completion). For example, type \fIp b:<TAB>\fR, select the bookmarks you want and press Enter, to print the file properties of the selected bookmarks (multi-selection is available).
.TP
.B br, bulk \fIELN/FILE\fR...
rename at once all files passed as arguments to the function. It accepts single and multiple file names, wildcards, ELN ranges, and the 'sel' keyword. Example: \fIbr\ myfile\ 4\-10\ sel\fR.
.sp
Each file name will be copied into a temporary file, which will be opened with the default text editor (via the \fImime\fR function), letting the user modify it. Once the file has been modified and saved, the modifications are printed on the screen and the user is asked whether to proceed with the actual bulk renaming or not.
.sp
This built-in bulk rename function won't deal with deletions, replacements, file name conflicts and the like. For a smarter alternative use \fBqmv\fR(1).
.TP
\fBc\fR, \fBl \fR[\fIe\fR, \fIedit\fR], \fBm\fR, \fBmd\fR, \fBr\fR
short for the following commands respectively: \fIcp\ \-iRp\fR, \fIln\ \-sn\fR, \fImv\ \-i\fR, \fImkdir\ \-p\fR, and \fIrm\ \-I\fR (for files) or \fIrm\ \-dIr\fR (for directories). To use these commands without any of these arguments, or with any other argument you need, just use the non-abbreviated command, for instance, \fIcp\fR instead of \fIc\fR.
.sp
The \fIln\fR command allows the use of the 'e, edit' option to modify the destination of a symbolic link. Example: \fIl\ e\ 12\fR, or \fIle\ 12\fR,  to relink the symbolic link corresponding to the ELN 12.
.sp
The \fIm\fR command is just like \fImv\ \-i\fR, but with the following differences: When using the \fIsel\fR keyword and no destiny is provided, \fIm\fR will move selected files into the current directory. Otherwise, whenever \fIsel\fR is not used, but just a source file name (and no destiny is provided), the \fIm\fR command behaves much like the \fBimv\fR(1) shell command (from the `renameutils` package), providing an interactive renaming function: it prompts the user to enter a new name using the source file name as base, so that it does not need to be typed twice. For this alternative prompt, only TAB completion for file names is available.
.sp
NOTE: On POSIX compliant systems, like NetBSD, the \fIr\fR command amounts to \fIrm\ \-r\fR for directories and \fIrm\ \-f\fR for files, since the \fI-I\fR option is not available and \fI-i\fR is too instrusive.
.sp
\fBclifm\fR supports \fIadvcp\fR, \fIwcp\fR, and \fIrsync\fR to copy files (they include a progress bar). To use them instead of \fIcp\fR set the corresponding option (\fIcpCmd\fR) in the configuration file. If \fIadvcp\fR is selected, the command used is \fIadvcp\ \-giRp\fR. If \fIrsync\fR, the command is \fIrsync\ \-avP\fR. \fIwcp\fR takes no argument.
.sp
\fIadvmv\fR is also supported to move files (to add a progress bar to \fImv\fR). Use the \fImvCmd\fR option in the configuration file to choose this alternative implementation of \fImv\fR. In this case, the command used is \fIadvmv\ \-gi\fR.

.TP
.B colors
print the color codes list currently used for files listing.
.TP
.B cd \fR[\fIELN/DIR\fR]
Change the current working directory to ELN/DIR.
.sp
Directories check order:
  1. If no argument, change to the home directory (\fBHOME\fR, or, if \fBHOME\fR is not set, the sixth field of the entry corresponding to the current user in \fI/etc/passwd\fR)
  2. If argument is an absolute path (begins with a slash character), or the first component is dot (.) or dot-dot (..), convert to canonical form (via \fBrealpath\fR(3)) and, if a valid directory, change into that directory.
  3. Check \fBCDPATH\fR environment variable and append /DIR to each of the paths specified here. If the result of the concatenation is a valid directory, change into it.
  4. Check directories in the current working directory. If a matching directory is found, change to it.
.sp
You can use either ELN's or a string to indicate the directory you want. Ex: \fIcd\ 12\fR or \fIcd\ ~/media\fR. If \fIautocd\fR is enabled (default), \fIcd\ 12\fR and \fIcd\ ~/media\fR could be written as \fI12\fR and \fI~/media\fR respectively as well.
.sp
Unlike the shell \fBcd\fR(1) command, \fBclifm\fR's built\-in \fIcd\fR function not only changes the current directory, but also lists its content (provided the option \fICdListsAutomatically\fR is enabled, which is the default) according to a comprehensive list of color codes. By default, the output of \fIcd\fR is much like this shell command: \fIcd\ DIR\ &&\ ls\ \-\-color=auto\ \-\-group\-directories\-first\fR.
.sp
Automatic files listing can be disabled by either setting \fIAutoLs\fR to "false" in the configuration file or running \fBclifm\fR with the \fI-o\fR or \fI--no-autols\fR option.
.TP
.B cl, columns \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR]
toggle columns on/off.
.TP
.B cmd, commands
show this list of commands. A more convenient way of getting information about \fBclifm\fR commands is via the interactive help plugin (depends on \fIfzf\fR), by default bound to the "ihelp" action name.
.TP
.B cs, colorschemes \fR[\fIedit\fR [\fIAPP\fR]] [\fINAME\fR]
with no arguments, list available color schemes. Use the \fIedit\fR option to open/edit the configuration file of the current color scheme (open with APP if specified or via the default associated application). Otherwise, just switch to the color scheme NAME. TAB completion is available.
.TP
.B d, dup \fIFILE\fR...
Duplicate files passed as parameters, either directories or regular files. The user will be asked for a destiny directory. Duplicated file names are generated by appending ".copy" to the basename of each source file. For example: \fId\ /my/file\fR will copy \fI/my/file\fR into the directory selected by the user as \fIfile.copy\fR. If \fIfile.copy\fR already exists, an extra suffix will be added as follows: \fIfile.copy\-N\fR, where N is a positive integer (starting at 1).
.sp
If \fBrsync\fR(1) is found, it will be used as follows: \fIrsync\ \-aczvAXHS\ \-\-progress\fR. Else, \fBcp\fR(1) will be used: \fIcp\ \-a\fR.
.TP
.B dc \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, \fIstatus\fR]
toggle the files counter function on/off.
.TP
.B ds, desel \fR[\fI*\fR, \fIa\fR, \fIall\fR] [\fIFILE\fR]...
deselect one or more selected files.
.sp
If no parameter is passed, the user is prompted to either mark selected files to be deselected or to edit the selections file (entering 'e') via a text editor to manually deselect files.
.sp
Use \fI*\fR, \fIa\fR or \fIall\fR to deselect all selected entries at once. Ex: \fIds\ *\fR.
.sp
You can also pass the file name(s) (or ELN's) to be deselected as a parameter. For example: \fIds\ myfile\ 24\fR.
.sp
TAB completion is available for this command.
.TP
.B edit \fR[\fIreset\fR] [\fIAPPLICATION\fR]
edit the main configuration file (F10 key is also available). If an application is specified, it will be used to open the configuration file. Use the 'reset' option to generate a fresh configuration file and create a backup copy of the old one (named clifmrc.YYYYMMDD@HH:MM:SS).
.TP
.B exp \fR[\fIFILE\fR]...
with no argument, export the list of files in the current working directory to a temporary file. Otherwise, export only those specified as further arguments: they could be directories, file names, ELN's or some search expression like "*.c".
.TP
.B ext \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, \fIstatus\fR]
toggle external commands on/off.
.TP
.B f, forth \fR[\fIh\fR, \fIhist\fR] [\fIclear\fR] [\fI!ELN\fR]
it works just like the \fIback\fR function, but it goes forward in the history record. Of course, you can use \fIf\ hist\fR, \fIf\ h\fR, \fIfh\fR, and \fIf\ !ELN\fR.
.TP
.B  fc, filescounter \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, \fIstatus\fR]
By default, \fBclifm\fR prints the amount of files contained by listed directories next to directories name. However, since this is an expensive feature, It might be desirable, for example, when listing files in a remote machine, to disable this feature. Use the 'off' option to disable it. To permanently disable it, use the FilesCounter option in the configuration file.
.TP
.B ff, dirs-first \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, \fIstatus\fI]
toggle list directories first on/off.
.TP
.B fs
Print an extract from 'What is Free Software?', written by Richard Stallman.
.TP
.B ft, filter \fR[\fIunset\fR] [[\fI!\fR]REGEX]
with no argument, print the current filter. To remove the current filter use the 'unset' option. To set a new filter enter \fIft\ [!]REGEX\fR. Use the exclamation mark to reverse the behavior or a filter. For example: \fIft\ !^\.\fR will prevent hidden files from being listed, just as 'ft ^D' will list only files starting with 'D'.
.sp
The filter will be lost at program exit. To permanently set a files filter use the \fIFilter\fR option (in the configuration file). You can also use the \fBCLIFM_FILTER\fR environment variable (see below), though the value of this variable will be lost at system shutdown or reboot.
.TP
.B fz \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR]
Toggle full directory size on/off (only for long view mode).
.TP
.B hf, hidden \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, status\fR]
toggle hidden files on/off.
.TP
.B history \fR[\fIedit\fR [\fIAPP\fR]] [\fIclear\fR] [\fI\-n\fR] [\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, \fIstatus\fR]
with no arguments, it shows the history list. If \fIclear\fR is passed as argument, it will delete all entries in the history file. Use 'edit' to open the history file and modify it if needed (the file will be opened with APP, if specified, or with the default associated application otherwise). \fI\-n\fR tells the \fIhistory\fR command to list only the last 'n' commands in the history list. Finally, you can disable history (subsequent entries won't be written to the history file) via \fIhistory\ off\fR.
.sp
You can use the exclamation mark (!) to perform some history commands:
  !!: Execute the last command.
  !n: Execute the command number 'n' in the history list.
  !\-n: Execute the last\-n command in the history list.
  ![STRING]: Execute command starting with STRING. TAB completion is available in this case.
.sp
TAB completion is available: just type \fI!\fR and then TAB to see the complete list of history commands, or \fI!str\fR and then TAB to see the list of entries matching 'STR'.
.TP
.B icons \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR]
toggle icons on/off
.TP
.B j, jc, jl, jp \fR[\fISTR\fR]..., \fBjo\fR [\fINUM\fR], \fBje\fR
\fIj\fR is the fastest way of using \fBKangaroo\fR, a \fBdirectory jumper\fR function to quickly navigate through the jump database (i.e. a database of visited directories).
.sp
With no argument, \fIj\fR just lists the entries in the jump database, printing the order number of the corresponding entry, the number of visits, the days since the first visit, the rank value, and the directory name itself (an asterisk next to the rank value means that the corresponding directory is bookmarked, the current directory in some workspace or pinned). Otherwise, it searches for STR in the database and cd into the best ranked matching entry. Example: \fIj\ D\fR will probably take you to \fI/home/user/Downloads\fR, provided this directory has been already visited and is the best ranked match in the database. For a more detailed description of the matching algorithm see the \fBKANGAROO FREQUENCY ALGORITHM\fR section below.
.sp
Multiple query strings could be passed to the function. For example, \fIj\ et\ mo\fR will first check for 'et' in the jump database and then will further filter the search using the second parameter: 'mo'. It will most probably take you (again, provided the directory has been already visited and is the best ranked match) to /etc/modprobe.d directory. Bear in mind that if STR is an actual directory, \fIjump\fR will just cd into it without performing any query.
.sp
The backslash (\\) and the slash (/) could be used to instruct \fBKangaroo\fR to search for the string query only in the first or last path segment of each entry in the database respectively. Let's suppose we have two entries matching \fBsrc\fR in the database: \fI/media/src/images\fR and \fI/home/user/Downloads/clifm/src\fR. If the first entry is better ranked than the second, \fIj src\fR will match this first entry. However, if what we really want is the second entry, appending a slash to the query string instructs \fBKangaroo\fR to only match entries having src in the last path segment, here \fI/home/user/Downloads/clifm/src\fR.
.sp
Since it is not always obvious or easy to know where exactly a query string will take you, \fBclifm\fR (if the suggestions system is enabled) will print, at the right of the cursor, the path matched by \fBKangaroo\fR. If that is the actually intended path, just press the Right arrow key to accept the suggestion. Otherwise, it will be ignored. You can also use TAB completion to print the list of matches for the current query string. For example: \fIj - c<TAB>\fR to list all entries in the directory history list containing a dash (-) and a 'c'.
.sp
\fIj\fR accepts five modifiers: 'e', 'p' 'c', 'o', and 'l', the first standing for "edit", the second for "parent", the third for "child", the fourth for "order", and the last one for 'list'. Thus, \fIje\fR will open the jump database to be edited if needed; \fIjc\fR will search for files querying only child directories relative to the current working directory, while \fIjp\fR will do the same but for parent directories. \fIjo\fR allows to specify an order number (the left most value in the jump list) instead of a string or a file name, in which case no matching process is performed. Finally, \fIjl\fR just prints the matches for the given query string(s), but without changing the current directory. Examples:
.sp
\fIjp\ foo\fR will take you to the most visited \fBparent\fR directory containing the string "foo".
.sp
\fIjc\ bar\ test\fR will take you to the most visited \fBchild\fR directory containing the strings "bar" and "test".
.sp
\fIjo\ 13\fR will cd into the path corresponding to the order number 13. TAB completion is available to expand order numbers into the corresponding paths.
.sp
\fIjl\ foo\fR will print all entries in the database matching the word "foo".
.sp
To reset or modify the jump database as you wish, simply open the jump file using the \fIje\fR command, edit whatever needs to be edited, save changes, and close the editor.
.sp
An alternative way of navigating the jump database is using the jumper plugin (located in the plugins directory and bound by default to the "++" action name), which uses \fIfzf\fR to enable fuzzy searches. Just enter \fI++\fR to perform a fuzzy search over the jump database.
.TP
.B kb, keybinds \fR[\fIedit\fR [\fIAPP\fR]] [\fIreset\fR] [\fIreadline\fR]
with no argument, prints the current keyboard codes and their associated functions. To edit the keybindings file, use the \fIedit\fR option (the file will be opened with APP, if specified, or with the default associated application otherwise). If you somehow messed up your keybindings, use the 'reset' option to create a fresh keybindings file with the default values. To list readline keybindings, use the \fIreadline\fR option. Bear in mind that these keybindings are not provided by \fBclifm\fR, but by readline itself, and as such depend on the system settings (they can be customized however via the \fI~/.inputrc\fR file).
.TP
.B lm \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR]
Toggle the light mode on/off. This option, aimed to make files listing faster than the default mode, is especially useful for really old hardware or when working on remote machines. For more details see the \fBNOTE ON SPEED\fR section below.
.TP
.B log \fR[\fIclear\fR] [\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, \fIstatus\fR]
with no arguments, it prints the contents of the log file. If \fIclear\fR is passed as argument, all the logs will be deleted. \fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, and \fIstatus\fR enable, disable, and check the status of the \fIlog\fR function for the current session.
.TP
.B media
.sp
\fBNOTE\fR: This command is Linux-specific
.sp
List available storage devices and mount/unmount the selected one using either \fIudevil\fR or \fIudisks2\fR (at least one of these must be installed. \fIudevil\fR will be preferred over \fIudisks2\fR). If the device is unmounted, it will be automatically mounted, and if mounted, it will be automatically unmounted.
.sp
Though mountpoints are determined by the mounting application itself (\fIudevil\fR or \fIudisks2\fR), \fBclifm\fR will automatically cd into the corresponding mountpoint whenever the mount operation was succesfull.
.sp
When unmounting, and if the current directory is inside the mountpoint, \fBclifm\fR will attempt to cd into the previous visited directory, and, if none, into the home directory, before unmounting the device.
.sp
To get information about a device, enter \fIiELN\fR, for example, \fIi12\fR, provided '12' is the ELN of the device you want.
.TP
.B mf \fR[\fINUM\fR, \fIunset\fR]
List only up to NUM files (valid range: >= 0). Use \fIunset\fR to list all files (default). An indicator (listed_files/total_files) will be printed below the list of files whenever some file is excluded from the current list (e.g. 20/310). Note however that though some files are excluded, all of them are loaded anyway, so that you can still perform any valid operation on them. For example, even if only 10 files are listed, you can still search for ALL symbolic links in the corresponding directory using the appropriate command: \fI/*\ -l\fR.
.TP
.B mm, mime \fR[\fIinfo ELN/FILENAME\fR] [\fIedit\fR] [\fIimport\fR]
This is \fILira\fR, \fBclifm\fR's resource opener. The \fIinfo\fR option prints the MIME information about ELN/FILENAME: its MIME type, and, if any, the application associated to this file name or to the file's MIME type.
.sp
The \fIedit\fR option allows you to edit and customize the MIME list file. So, if a file has no default associated application, first get its MIME info or its file extension (running \fImm\ info\ FILE\fR), and then add a value for it to the MIME list file using the \fIedit\fR option (\fImm\ edit\fI or F6). Check the \fBRESOURCE OPENER\fR section below for information about the mimelist file syntax.
.sp
Finally, via the \fIimport\fR option \fBclifm\fR will try to import MIME associations from the system looking for \fImimeapps.list\fR files in those paths specified by the Freedesktop specification (see \fIhttps://specifications.freedesktop.org/mime-apps-spec/mime-apps-spec-latest.html\fR). If at least one MIME association is successfuly imported, it will be stored as \fImimelist.clifm.XXXXXX\fR (where XXXXXX is a random six digits alphanumerical string). You can add these new associations to your mimelist file using the \fImime edit\fR command.
.TP
.B mp, mountpoints
list available mountpoints and change the current working directory to the selected mountpoint.
.TP
.B msg, messages \fR[\fIclear\fR]
with no arguments, prints the list of messages in the current session. The \fIclear\fR option tells \fBclifm\fR to empty the messages list.
.TP
.B n, new \fR[\fIFILE\fR]... [\fIDIR/\fR]...
create new empty files and/or directories. If a file name ends with a slash (/), it will be taken as a directory name and created via the shell command \fImkdir\ \-p\fR. Else, it will be created via \fBtouch\fR(1). Ex: \fIn\ myfile\ mydir/\fR, to create a file named \fImyfile\fR and a directory named \fImydir\fR. If no file name is specified, the user will be asked for one. If one or more of the specified file names already exist, ".new" will be appended to the file name.
.TP
.B net \fR[\fINAME\fR] [\fIedit\fR] [\fIm\fR, \fImount NAME\fR] [\fIu\fR, \fIunmount NAME\fR]
\fB1. The configuration file\fR
.sp
The \fInet\fR command manages connections to remote systems via a simple samba-like configuration file (\fI$HOME/.config/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/nets.clifm\fR). Here you can specify multiple remotes and options for each of these remotes. Syntax example for this file:
.sp
 [remote_name]
 Comment=A nice descriptive comment
 Mountpoint=/path/to/mountpoint
 MountCmd=sudo mount.cifs //192.168.0.12/share %m -o OPTIONS
 UnmountCmd=sudo umount %m
 AutoUnmount=true (Auto-unmount this remote at exit)
 AutoMount=false (Auto-mount this remote at startup)
.sp
\fBNote\fR: \fI%m\fR could be used as a placeholder for \fIMountpoint\fR. \fI%m\fR will be replaced by the value of \fIMountpoint\fR.
.sp
\fB1.a.\fR Mounting remote file systems
.sp
\fBA Samba share\fR:
  [samba_share]
  Comment=My samba share
  Mountpoint="~/.config/clifm/mounts/smb_share"
  MountCmd=sudo mount.cifs //192.168.0.26/samba_share %m -o mapchars,credentials=/etc/samba/credentials/samba_share
  UnmountCmd=sudo umount %m
  AutoUnmount=false
  AutoMount=false

\fBA SSH file system (sshfs)\fR:
  [ssh_share]
  Comment=My ssh share
  Mountpoint="/media/ssh"
  MountCmd=sshfs user@192.168.0.26: %m -C -p 22
  UnmountCmd=fusermount3 -u %m
  AutoUnmount=true
  AutoMount=false
.sp
\fB1.b.\fR Mounting local file systems
.sp
Though originally intended to manage remote file systems, \fInet\fR can also manage \fBlocal file systems\fR. Just provide the appropriate mount and unmount commands. Since the device name assigned by the kernel might change accross reboots (specially when it comes to removable drives), it is recommended to mount using the device's UUID (Universal Unique Identifier) instead of the drive name. For example:

  MountCmd=sudo mount -U c98d91g4-6781... %m

Here's an example of how to set up \fInet\fR to mount USB devices, one with a FAT file system, and another with an ISO9660 file system:

  [Sandisk USB]
  Comment=Sandisk USB drive
  Mountpoint="/media/usb"
  MountCmd=sudo mount -o gid=1000,fmask=113,dmask=002 -U 5847-xxxx %m
  UnmountCmd=sudo umount %m
  AutoUnmount=false
  AutoMount=false

  [Kingston USB]
  Comment=Kingston USB drive
  Mountpoint="/media/usb2"
  MountCmd=sudo mount -t iso9660 -U 2020-10-01-15-xx-yy-zz %m
  UnmountCmd=sudo umount %m
  AutoUnmount=false
  AutoMount=false

\fBNOTE\fR: The \fIgid\fR, \fIfmask\fR, and \fIdmask\fR options are used to allow the user to access the mountpoint without elevated privileges.
.sp
If the device data is unknown, as it often happens when it comes to removable devices, you should use the \fImedia\fR command instead.
.sp
\fB2. Command syntax\fR
.sp
Without arguments, \fInet\fR lists the configuration for each remote available in the configuration file.
.sp
Use the \fIedit\fR option to edit the remotes configuration file. If no further argument is specified, the file will be opened with the current resource opener. However, you can pass an application as second parameter to open to configuration file. Example: 'net edit nano'.
.sp
If not already mounted, the \fIm\fR, \fImount\fR option mounts the specified remote using the mount command and the mounpoint specified in the confifuration file and automatically cd into the corresponding mountpoint. Example: \fInet m smb_work\fR. \fIm\fR, \fImount\fR could be omitted, so that \fInet smb_work\fR amounts to \fInet m smb_work\fR. TAB completion is available for this function.
.sp
The \fIu\fR, \fIunmount\fR option unmounts the specified remote using the unmount command specified in the configuration file. For example: \fInet u smb_work\fR. TAB completion is also available for this function.
.sp
\fBNOTE\fR: If you only need to copy some files to a remote location (including mobile phones) without the need to mount the resource, you can make use of the cprm.sh plugin, bound by default to the \fIcr\fR action. Just set up your remotes (\fIcr edit\fR) and then simply send the file you want (\fIcr FILE\fR). That's all.
.TP
.B o, open \fIELN/FILE\fR [\fIAPPLICATION\fR]
open FILE, which can be either a directory, in which case it works just like the \fIcd\fR command (see above), a regular file, or a symbolic link to either of the two. For example: \fIo\ 12\fR, \fIo\ filename\fR, \fIo\ /path/to/filename\fR.
.sp
By default, the \fIopen\fR function will open files with the default application associated to them via \fILira\fR, the built\-in resource opener (see the \fImime\fR command above). However, if you want to open a file with a different application, just add the application name as second argument, e.g. \fIo\ 12\ leafpad\fR or \fIo12\ leafpad\fR.
.sp
If you want to run the program in the background, simply add the ampersand character, as usual: \fIo\ 12\ &\fR, \fIo\ 12&\fR, \fIo12&\fR or (if auto-open is enabled) just \fI12&\fR.
.sp
If the file to be opened is an archive/compressed file, the archive function (see the \fIad\fR command above) will be executed instead.
.TP
.B ow \fIELN/FILE\fR [\fIAPPLICATION\fR]
Print a list of available applications associated to _ELN/FILENAME (either via its MIME type or its file extension), allowing the user to choose one of these applications, and then open the file with the selected application. In simple words, this is what in most GUI file managers is called \fBOpen with...\fR This command supports TAB completion: just type "\fIow filename \fR", then press TAB, and those applications able to open FILENAME will be listed.
.TP
.B opener \fR[\fIdefault\fR] [\fIAPPLICATION\fR]
with no argument, prints the currently used resource opener (by default, \fILira\fR, \fBclifm\fR's built\-in opener). Otherwise, set APPLICATION as opener or, if \fIdefault\fR is passed instead, use \fILira\fR.
.TP
.B p, pr, prop \fIELN/FILE\fR...
print file properties for ELN/FILE. The output of this function is much like the combined output of \fIls\ \-l\fR and \fIstat\fR. By default, directories size is not shown. Use \fIpp\fR instead of just \fIp\fR to print directories size as well (it could take longer depending on the directory's content).
.sp
If you need to list the properties of all files in the current directory, try the long view mode (\fIAlt-l\fR). Fields displayed in this mode can be customized using the \fIPropFields\fR option in the configuration file.
.sp
For more information about file details consult the file-details help topic: \fIhelp file\-details\fR.
.TP
.B path, cwd
print the current working directory.
.TP
.B pf, prof, profile \fR[\fIls\fR, \fIlist\fR] [\fIset\fR, \fIadd\fR, \fIdel PROFILE\fR]
with no arguments, prints the name of the currently used profile. Use the \fIls\fR or \fIlist\fR option to list available profiles. To switch, add or delete a profile, use the \fIset\fR, \fIadd\fR, and \fIdel\fR options respectively followed by the corresponding profile name. Bear in mind that, when switching profiles, command line arguments will be ignored.
.TP
.B pg, pager \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, \fIstatus\fR]
toggle \fBMas\fR, the built-in pager, on/off. Useful to list directories with hundreds or thousands of files, the pager will start working, if set to on, whenever the screen is not enough to list all files.
.sp
Once in the pager, press the Down arrow key, Space or Enter to move downwards one line, or PageDown to move downwards an entire page. To go upwards, use the shortcuts provided by your terminal emulator, for example, Alt\-PageUp or Alt\-Up. Press 'c', 'p', or 'q' keys to stop the pager, and 'h' or '?' for help.
.TP
.B pin \fR[\fIFILE/DIR\fR]
pin a file or a directory to be accessed later via the comma (,) keyword. For example, run \fIpin mydir\fR and then access \fImydir\fR as follows: \fIcd\ \,\fR where the comma is automatically expanded to the pinned file, in this case \fImydir\fR. The comma keyword could be used with any command, either internal or external, e.g, \fIls\ \,\fR.
.sp
With no arguments, the \fIpin\fR command prints the current pinned file, if any. If an argument is given, it will be taken as a file name to be pinned. Running this command again, frees the previous pinned file and sets a new one. In other words, only one pin is supported at a time. 
.sp
An easy alternative to create as many pins or shortcuts as you want, and how you want, is to use the \fIalias\fR function. Bookmarks could also be used to achieve a very similar result.
.sp
At program exit, the pinned file is written to a file in the configuration directory (as .pin) to be loaded in the next session.
.TP
.B prompt \fR[\fINAME\fR, \fIlist\fR, \fIedit\fR, \fIreload\fR]
Temporarily change the current prompt to the prompt named NAME. Available prompts (which can be listed via \fIprompt list\fR or just \fIprompt <TAB>\fR) are defined in the prompts file (\fI$HOME/.config/clifm/prompts.clifm\fR). To permanently set a prompt, edit your color scheme file (via the \fIcs edit\fR command) and set \fIPrompt\fR to either a prompt code and a prompt name (as defined in the prompts file).
.TP
.B q, quit, exit, Q
Gracefully quit \fBclifm\fR. Use \fIQ\fR to gracefully quit and enable the CD on quit functionality (write last visited directory to \fI$XDG\_CONFIG/clifm/\.last\fR to be later read by a shell function. See the \fBSHELL\ FUNCTIONS\fR section below).
.TP
.B rf, refresh
refresh the screen, that is, reprint files in the current directory and update the prompt. If the current directory is not accessible for any reason, \fIrf\fR will go up until it finds an accessible one and then will change to that directory.
.TP
.B rl, reload
Reload all settings, except those passed as command line arguments, from the configuration file.
.TP
.B rr \fR[\fIDIR\fR] [\fIEDITOR\fR]
Remove files and/or directories in bulk using a text editor.
.sp
\fIrr\fR sends all files in \fIDIR\fR (or in the current directory if \fIDIR\fR is omitted) to a temporary file and opens it using \fIEDITOR\fR (or the default associated application for \fItext/plain\fR MIME type, if \fIEDITOR\fR is omitted).
.sp
Once in the editor, remove the lines corresponding to the files you want to delete. Save changes and close the editor. Removed files will be listed and the user asked for confirmation.
.TP
.B s, sel \fIELN/FILE\fR... [[\fI!\fR]\fIPATTERN\fR] [\fI\-filetype\fR] [\fI:PATH\fR]
send one or multiple elements (either files or directories) to the Selection Box. \fIsel\fR accepts individual elements, range of elements, say 1\-6, file names and paths, just as wildcards (globbing) and regular expressions. Example: \fIs\ 1\ 4\-10\ \^r\ file*\ file\ name /path/to/filename\fR. To deselect selected files, use the \fIds\fR command (see above), or the M-d keyboard shortcut.
.sp
If not in light mode, once a file is selected, and if the file is in the current working directory, the corresponding file name will be marked with an asterisk (colored according to the value of \fIli\fR in the color scheme file (by default bold green)), at the left of the file name (and at the right of its ELN).
.sp
Just as in the \fIsearch\fR function, it is also possible to further filter the list of matches indicating the desired file type. For instance, \fIs\ \^ \-d\fR will select all directories in the current working directory. For available file type filters see the \fIsearch\fR function above.
.sp
By default, the selection function operates on the current working directory. To select files in any other directory use the ":PATH" expression. For example, to select all regular files with a .conf extension in the /etc directory, the command would be: \fIs\ .*\\.conf$\ \-r :/etc\fR, or using wildcards: \fIs\ *.conf\ \-r\ :/etc\fR.
.sp
Just as in the case of the \fIsearch\fR function, inverse matching is supported for patterns, either wildcards or regular expressions. To invert or reverse the meaning and action of a pattern, just prepend an exclamation mark (!). E.g., to select all non-hidden regular files in the Documents directory, issue this command: \fIs\ !^\.\ \-r\ :Documents\fR, or, to select all directories in /etc, except those ending with ".d": \fIs\ !*.d\ \-d\ :/etc\fR.
.sp
Glob and regular expressions could be used together. For example: \fIs\ ^[r|R].*d$ /etc/*.conf\fR will select all files starting with either 'r' or 'R' and ending with 'd' in the current working directory, plus all .conf files in the \fI/etc\fR directory. However, this use is discouraged if both patterns refer to the same directory, since the second one will probably override the result of the first one.
.sp
It is important to note that glob expressions are evaluated before regular expressions, in such a way that any pattern that could be understood by both kinds of pattern matching mechanisms will be evaluated first according to the former, that is, as a glob expression. For example, '.*', as regular expression, should match all files. However, since glob expressions are evaluated first, it will only match hidden files. To select all files using a glob expression, try '.* *', or, with a regular expression: '^' or '(.*?)'. The keyboard shortcut M-a is also available to perform the same operation.
.sp
The Selection Box is accessible to different instances of the program, provided they use the same profile (see the \fIprofile\fR command below). By default, indeed, each profile keeps a private Selection Box, being thus not accessible to other profiles. You can nonetheless modify this behavior via the ShareSelbox option in the configuration file. If the ShareSelbox option is enabled (see the configuration file), selected files are stored in \fI/tmp/clifm/username/.selbox.clifm\fR. Otherwise, \fI/tmp/clifm/username/.selbox_profilename.clifm\fR is used (this is the default).
.sp
To operate on selected files, use the \fIsel\fR keyword. 
.sp
\fBNote\fR:  If there is a file named \fIsel\fR in the current directory, use \fI./sel\fR to distinguish it from the \fIsel\fR keyword. For example, enter \fIp ./sel\fR to tell CliFM that you want to get the properties of the file named sel rather than the properties of the currently selected files.
.sp
For more information consult the \fBBUILT-IN EXPANSIONS\fR section below.

.TP
.B sb, selbox

.TP
.B splash

.B st, sort \fR[\fIMETHOD\fR] [\fIrev\fR]
with no argument, print the current sorting method. Else, set sorting method to METHOD, where METHOD could be one of: 0 = none, 1 = name, 2 = size, 3 = atime, 4 = btime (ctime, if btime is not available), 5 = ctime, 6 = mtime, 7 = version (name, if ctime is not available), 8 = extension, and 9 = inode, 10 = owner, and 11 = group. Both numbers and names are allowed. Bear in mind that methods 10 and 11 sort by owner and group ID number, not by owner and group names.
.sp
By default, files are sorted from less to more (ex: from 'a' to 'z' if using the "name" method). Use the \fIrev\fR option to invert this order. Ex: \fIst\ rev\fR or \fIst\ 3\ rev\fR. Switch back to the previous ordering running \fIst rev\fR again.
.TP
.B stats
print statistics about files in the current directory (not available in light mode).

.B t, tr, trash \fR[\fIELN/FILE\fR]... [\fIls\fR, \fIlist\fR] [\fIclear\fR, \fIempty\fR] [\fIdel\fR [\fIFILE\fR]...]]
with no argument (or by passing the \fIls\fR option), it prints the list of currently trashed files. The \fIclear\fR or \fIempty\fR parameter removes all files from the trash can, while the \fIdel\fR parameter lists trashed files allowing the user to remove one or more of them. If using \fIdel\fR, TAB completion to list/select currently trashed files is available.
.sp
The trash directory is \fI$XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash\fR, usually \fI~/.local/share/Trash\fR. Since this trash system follows the Freedesktop specification, it is able to handle files trashed by different Trash implementations.
.sp
To undelete/untrash trashed files see the \fIundel\fR command below.

.B tag \fR[\fIls\fR, \fIlist\fR] [\fInew\fR] [\fIrm\fR, \fIremove\fR] [\fImv\fR, \fIrename\fR] [\fIuntag\fR] [\fImerge\fR] [\fIFILE\fR]... [[\fI:\fR]\fITAG\fR]
\fItag\fR is the main \fIEtiqueta\fR command, \fBclifm\fR's built-in files tagging system. See the \fBFILE TAGS\fR section for a complete description of this command.
.TP
.B te \fIFILE\fR...
toggle executable bit (on user, group, and others) on FILE(s). It is equivalent to the \fB-x\fR and \fB+x\fR options for the \fBchmod\fR(1) command.

.B u, undel, untrash \fR[\fI*\fR, \fIa\fR, \fIall\fR] [\fIFILE\fR]...
If file names are passed as parameters, undelete these files, that is, restore them to their original location. Otherwise, this function prints a list of currently trashed files allowing you to choose one or more of these files to be undeleted. Use the \fI*\fR, \fIa\fR or \fIall\fR parameters to undelete all trashed files at once. TAB completion to list/select currently trashed files is available.
.TP
.B uc, unicode \fR[\fIon\fR, \fIoff\fR, \fIstatus\fR]
toggle unicode on/off.
.TP
.B unpin
this command takes no argument. It just frees the current pin and, if it exists, deletes the \fI.pin\fR file generated by the \fIpin\fR command..TP
.B v, vv, paste \fRsel [\fIDESTINY\fR]
the '\fIpaste sel\fR' or '\fIv sel\fR' command copies the currently selected files, if any, into the current working directory. To copy these files into another directory, tell 'paste' where to copy these files. Ex: '\fIpaste sel /path/to/directory\fR'. The \fIcopy\fR command (\fIc\fR) could be used in the same way: '\fIc sel\fR' indeed copies selected files into the current directory. Use the '\fIvv\fR' command instead of just '\fIv\fR' to copy selected files into DESTINY and rename them at once: '\fIvv sel DIR\fR'.

With no argument, the \fIws\fR command prints the list of workspaces and its corresponding paths, highlighting the current workspace. Use NUM to switch to workspace NUM, NAME to switch to the workspace named NAME, the plus sign (+) to switch to the next workspace, and the minus sign (-) to switch to the previous workspace. Four keyboard shortcuts are available to easily switch to any of the first four workspaces: \fBAlt-[1-4]\fR.
.sp
Every time an empty workspace is created, it starts in the path to the workspace from which it was invoked (in other words, in the current working directory).
.sp
Though by default workspaces are unnamed, you can name them wathever you like using the \fIWorkspaceNames\fR option in the configuration file.
.TP
.B x, X \fR[\fIDIR\fR]
open DIR, or the current working directory if DIR is not specified, in a new instance of \fBclifm\fR (as root if \fIX\fR, as the current unprivileged user if \fIx\fR) using the value of \fITerminalCmd\fR (from the configuration file) as terminal emulator. If this value is not set, \fIxterm\fR will be used as fallback terminal emulator. This function is only available for graphical environments.

.SH 6. FILE FILTERS
\fBclifm\fR offers four kinds of file filters:
.sp
 a) A dot filter to permanently exclude hidden files from the files list. See the \fB-A\fR and \fB-a\fR options above.
.sp
 b) Files filter via regular expressions (using the \fIFilter\fR option in the configuration file or the CLIFM_FILTER environment variable) to permanently exclude certain groups of file names, for example, backup files or files ending with a tilde (~).
.sp
 c) Local filter via the \fIQuick search\fR function (supporting both regular expressions, wildcards, and invert matching) to temporarily filter the current list of files.
.sp
d) Filtering files via the TAB key:
.sp
You can filter files using wildcards (always preceded by a command). For example: \fIp *.pdf<TAB>\fR to get a list of PDF files in the current directory.
.sp
Files can be filtered as well using the '=' keyword followed by a file type filter character. For example, \fI=l<TAB>\fR to get a list of symbolic links in the current directory. The list of available file type characters is as follows:

 \fBb\fR: Block devices
 \fBc\fR: Character devices
 \fBC\fR: Files with capabilities
 \fBd\fR: Directories
 \fBf\fR: Regular files
 \fBg\fR: SGID files
 \fBh\fR: Multi-hardlink files (directories excluded)
 \fBl\fR: Symbolic links
 \fBo\fR: Other-writable files
 \fBp\fR: FIFO/pipes
 \fBs\fR: Sockets
 \fBt\fR: Files with the sticky bit set
 \fBu\fR: SUID files
 \fBx\fR: Executable files
.sp
If using FZF for TAB completion, multi-selection is allowed.

.TP
NOTE 2: Some of these keybindings might not work on your console/terminal emulator, depending on your system. Some useful tips on this regard:
.TP
Haiku terminal: Most of these keybindings won't work on the Haiku terminal, since Alt plays here the role Ctrl usually plays in most other systems (see the Haiku documentation). To fix this just set your custom keybindings.
.TP
Kernel built-in console: Key sequences involving the Shift key (S-up, S-left, and S-right in our case) will just not work. Use the alternative key sequences instead: M-u, M-j, and M-k respectively
.TP
NetBSD (wsvt25) and OpenBSD (vt220) kernel consoles: Key sequences involving the Alt key won't work out of the box. Here's how to make it work:

 On OpenBSD:
 1) Copy /etc/examples/wsconsctl.conf to /etc (if it does not already exist)
 2) Add the metaesc flag to your current keyboard enconding. For example keyboard.encoding=us.metaesc
 You might need to reboot the machine for changes to take effect.

 On NetBSD:
 Add the metaesc flag to your current encoding in /etc/wscons.conf. Example: encoding us.metaesc
 You might need to reboot the machine for changes to take effect.
.TP
Konsole: If Shift+left and Shift+right are not already bound to any function, you need to bind them manually. Go to Settings -> Edit current profile -> Keyboard -> Default (Xfree4), and add these values:
 Left+Shift	\\E[1;2D
 Right+Shift	\\E[1;2C
.sp
If they are already bound, by contrast, you only need to unbound them. Go to "Settings -> Configure keyboard shortcuts", click on the corresponding keybinding, and set it to "Custom (none)").
.TP
Terminology/Yakuake: Shift+left and Shift+right are already bound to other functions, so that you only need to unbind them or rebind the corresponding functions to different key sequences.
.TP
Of course, the above two procedures should be similar in case of keybinding issues in other terminal emulators.
.TP
In case some of these keybindings are already used by your Window Manager, you only need to unbind the key or rebind the corresponding function to another key. Since each Window Manager uses its own mechanisms to set/unset keybindings, you should consult the appropriate manual.
.TP
\fBCustomizing keybindings\fR
.TP
The above are the default keyboard shortcuts. However, they can be freely modified using the 'kb edit' command (or pressing F9) or just editing the keybindings file (see the \fBFILES\fR section below) to your liking.
.TP
Since \fBclifm\fR does not depend on the curses library, keybindings are set up via ANSI escape codes, for example, "\e[17~" for the F6 key. The two main difficulties with ANSI escape codes are: 1) They are not intuitive at all, and 2) They vary depending on the terminal emulator used. This is why we provide a plugin (kbgen) to more easily configure your keybindings.
.TP
The plugin can be found in the plugins directory as a C source file. The first step, therefore, is to compile this source file to produce a binary file. Compile as follows:
.TP
 gcc -o kbgen kbgen.c
.TP
\fBNote\fR: Depending on your system, you might need to link against the curses library adding either \fB-lcurses\fR or \fB-lncurses\fR to the above line. 
.TP
Now, just run the plugin entering './kbgen'. Use either octal, hexadecimal codes or symbols. Example: For F12 'kbgen' will print the following lines:
.sp
 Hex  | Oct  | Symbol
 ---- | ---- | ------
 \\x1b | \\033 | ESC (\\e)
 \\x5b | \\133 | [
 \\x32 | \\062 | 2
 \\x34 | \\064 | 4
 \\x7e | \\176 | ~
.TP
In this case, supposing you want to use F12 to open the configuration file, the keybinding would be any of the following:
.sp
 open-config:\\x1b\\x5b\\x32\\x34\\x7e (Hex)
 open-config:\\033\\133\\062\\064\\176 (Oct)
 open-config:\\e[24~ (Symbol)
.TP
GNU emacs escape sequences are also allowed (ex: "\\M-a", Alt-a in most keyboards, or "\\C-r" for Ctrl-r). Some codes, especially those involving keys like Ctrl or the arrow keys, vary depending on the terminal emulator and the system settings. These keybindings should be set up thus on a per terminal basis. You can also consult the terminfo database via the \fIinfocmp\fR command. See \fBterminfo\fR(5) and \fBinfocmp\fR(1).
.TP
.B Readline keybindings
.TP
System readline keybindings for command line editing, such as \fICtrl-a\fR, to move the cursor to the beginning of the line, or \fICtrl-e\fR, to move it to the end, should work out of the box. Of course, you can modify readline keybindings using the \fI$HOME/.inputrc\fR file, either globally or for some specific terminal or application. In this latter case, it is possible to set keybindings specifically for \fBclifm\fR using the \fIapplication\fR construct, that is, telling readline that the following keybindings apply only to \fBclifm\fR. For example, to bind the function "kill-whole-line" to \fICtrl-b\fR, add the following lines to your \fI.inputrc\fR file:
.sp
 $if clifm
 "\\C\-b": kill\-whole\-line
 $endif
.TP
.B Keybindings for plugins
.TP
\fBclifm\fR provides four customizable keybindings for custom plugins. The procedure for setting a keybinding for a plugin is the following:
 1) Copy your plugin to the plugins directory (or use any of the plugins already in there)
 2) Link pluginx (where 'x' is the plugin number [1-4]) to your plugin using the 'actions edit' command. Ex: "plugin1=myplugin.sh"
 3) Set a keybinding for pluginx using the 'kb edit' command. Ex: "plugin1:\\M\-7"

.SH 8. THEMING
.TP
All customization settings (theming) are made from a single configuration file (the color scheme file), installed by default in \fIXDG_DATA_DIRS/clifm/colors\fR (usuallly \fI/usr/local/share/clifm/colors\fR or \fI/usr/share/clifm/colors\fR), though color scheme files found in \fIXDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/colors\fR (usually \fIHOME/.config/clifm/colors\fR) take precedence.
.TP
\fBNote\fR: Color scheme files are copied automatically into the local colors directory when running the \fIcs edit\fR command.
.TP
Each color scheme file includes:
.TP
 \fIFiletypeColors\fR = Colors for different file types, such as directory, regular files, and so on. See the \fBCOLORS\fR section below.
.TP
 \fIInterfaceColors\fR = Colors for \fBclifm\fR's interface, such as ELN's, file properties bits, suggestions, syntax highlighting, etc. See the \fBCOLORS\fR section below.
.TP
 \fIExtColors\fR = Colors for files based of file name's extension. See the \fBCOLORS\fR section below.
.TP
 \fIDirIconColor\fR = Color for the directory icon (when icons are enabled). See the \fBCOLORS\fR section below. Only when using icons-in-terminal or Nerfonts. If using rather emoji-icons (default build), this option is ignored.
.TP
 \fIPrompt\fR = Define CliFM's prompt. See the \fBTHE PROMPT\fR section below.
.TP
 \fIDividingLine\fR = The line dividing the current list of files and the prompt. See the \fBTHE DIVIDING LINE\fR below.
.TP
 \fIFzfTabOptions\fR = Options to be passed to fzf when using the fzf mode for TAB completion, including colors. See the \fBBUILT-IN EXPANSIONS\fR section below.
.TP
The color scheme (or just theme) can be set either via the command line (\fI--color-scheme=NAME\fR), via the \fIColorScheme\fR option in the main configuration file, or using the \fIcs\fR command, for instance, \fIcs mytheme\fR. Enter just \fIcs\fR to list available color schemes (TAB completion is available). To edit the current color scheme enter \fIcs edit\fR.
.TP
.B 1. COLORS
.TP
All color codes are specified in the corresponding color scheme file (by default \fI~/.config/clifm/colors/default.clifm\fR). You can edit this file pressing \fBF8\fR or entering \fIcs edit\fR.
.TP
\fBColor codes\fR
.TP
Colors are specified using the same format used by \fBdircolors\fR(1) and the \fBLS_COLORS\fR environment variable, namely, a colon separated list of codes with this general format: \fIfiletype=color\fR. This is the list of \fBfile type codes\fR (you'll find them in the \fIFiletypeColors\fR section of the current color scheme file):
.sp
 di = directory
 ed = empty directory
 nd = directory with no read permission
 ne = empty directory with no read permission
 fi = regular file
 ef = empty regular file
 nf = file with no access permission
 ln = symlink
 mh = multi-hardlink file
 or = orphaned or broken symlink
 bd = block device
 cd = character device
 pi = FIFO, pipe
 so = socket
 su = SUID file
 sg = SGID file
 tw = sticky and other writable directory
 st = sticky and not other writable directory
 ow = other writable directory
 ex = executable file
 ee = empty executable file
 ca = file with capabilities
 no = unknown file type
 uf = unaccessible files (\fBfstatat\fR(3) error)

.TP
The following codes are used for different interface elements (in the \fIInterfaceColors\fR section of the current color scheme file):
.sp
 \fBSuggestions\fR
 sb = shell built-ins
 sc = aliases and shell command names
 sf = ELN's plus bookmarks, file, tag, and directory names
 sh = commands history entries
 sx = suggestions for \fBclifm\fR's internal commands and parameters
 sp = suggestions pointer (ex: 56 > filename, where '>' is the suggestion pointer)

 \fBSyntax highlighting\fR
 hb = brackets '()[]{}'
 hc = comments (lines starting with '#')
 hd = slashes
 he = expansion chars '~*'
 hn = numbers
 hp = option parameters (starting with '-')
 hq = quoted strings (both single and double quotes)
 hr = process redirection (>)
 hs = process separators (; & |)
 hv = variable names (starting with '$')

 \fBPrompt elements\fR
 li = selected files
 ti = trash indicator
 em = error message indicator
 wm = warning message indicator
 nm = notice message indicator
 si = stealth mode indicator
 tx = command line text (regular prompt)
 wp = command line text (warning prompt)

 \fBFile properties\fR
 dn = Dash (unset property)
 dr = Read permission bit
 dw = Write permission bit
 dxd = Executable permission bit (directories)
 dxr = Executable permission bit (regular files)
 dp = SUID, SGID, sticky bit
 dg = File ID (UID, GID) whenever the current user owns the file or is in the file's group
 dd = Last modification time
 dz = Directories size
 do = Octal value for file properties

 \fBMiscellaneous interface elements\fR
 bm  = bookmarked directory in the bookmarks screen
 fc  = files counter
 df  = default color
 dl  = dividing line
 el  = ELN color
 mi  = misc indicators (disk usage, sort method, bulk rename, jump database list)
 ts  = matching suffix for possible TAB completed entries
 tt  = tilde for trimmed file names
 wc  = welcome message
 wsN = color for workspace N (1-8)
 xs  = exit code: success
 xf  = exit code: failure
.TP
Color codes are just traditional ANSI color codes less the escape character and the final 'm'. Thus, for instance, if you want non\-empty directories to be bold blue, add this to the \fIFiletypeColors\fR line in the corresponding color scheme file: \fBdi=01;34\fR. If you want ELN's to be red, add this code to the \fIInterfaceColors\fR line: \fBel=00;31\fR
.TP
Color codes can be used for file extensions as well using this format: *.ext=color. For example, to print C source files in bold green, add this to the \fIExtColors\fR line in the corresponding color scheme file: \fB*.c=01;32\fR
.TP
Six digits \fIhexadecimal\fR color codes are supported as well using this general format: \fB#RRGGBB[-[1-9]]\fR, where 1-9 is a display attribute. For example, if you want directories to be bold Spring Green: \fBdi=#00ff7f-1\fR.
.TP
\fBColor variables\fR
.TP
Up to 64 custom color variables can be used via the \fIdefine\fR keyword to make it easier to build and read theme files. Example:

 define RED=00;31
 define MY_SPECIAL_COLOR=04;38;2;255;255;0;48;2;0;14;191

 FiletpeColors="di=RED:"
 InterfaceColors="el=MY_SPECIAL_COLOR:"
.TP
These variables can only be used for \fIFiletypeColors\fR, \fIInterfaceColors\fR, \fIExtColors\fR, and \fIDirIconColor\fR. The \fIPrompt\fR line (if using a prompt code) use full ANSI escape sequences instead.
.TP
Though by default \fBclifm\fR uses only 8 colors (16 with the high intensity variant), you can use 256 and RGB colors as well. Example:

 \fBfi=04;38;2;245;76;00;48;2;00;00;255\fR
.TP
will print regular files underlined and using a bold orange RGB color on a blue background. In this case, just make sure to use a terminal emulator supporting RGB colors. To test your terminal color capabilities use the \fIcolors.sh\fR script (in the plugins directory).
.TP
\fBNOTE\fR: It might happen that, for some reason, you need to force \fBclifm\fR to use colors despite the value of the \fBTERM\fR variable. The OpenBSD console, for example, sets \fBTERM\fR to \fIvt220\fR by default, which, according to the \fIterminfo\fR database, does not support color. However, the OpenBSD console does actually support color. In this case, you can set the \fBCLIFM_FORCE_COLOR\fR to either \fItrue\fR or  \fI1\fR to use color even if the value of \fBTERM\fR says otherwise.
.TP
To see a colored list of the currently used file color codes run \fIcc\fR or \fIcolors\fR in \fBclifm\fR.
.TP
To run colorless use the \fI--no-color\fR command line option or set either \fBCLIFM_NO_COLOR\fR or \fBNO_COLOR\fR environment variables to any value. For more information about the no-color initiative see \fIhttps://no-color.org/\fR
.TP
For a full no-color experience recall to edit your prompt removing all color codes.
.TP
.B 2. THE PROMPT
.TP
\fBclifm\fR's prompt (regular and warning ones) is taken from the \fIPrompt\fR line in the color scheme file using a prompt name as defined in the prompts file, for example, \fIPrompt="security-scanner"\fR.
.TP
Prompts can be customized via the \fIprompt edit\fR command.
.TP
Each prompt is built following almost the same escape codes and rules used by the Bash prompt, except that it does not accept shell functions (like conditionals and loops). Command substitution (in the form $(cmd)), string literals, and escape codes can be used to build the prompt line and its colors. This is a list of supported escape codes:
.TP
\fB\\e\fR: Escape character
.TP
\fB\\s\fR: The name of the shell (everything after the last slash) currently used by \fBclifm\fR
.TP
\fB\\S\fR: Current workspace number (or name, if named), colored according to \fIwsN\fR code in the \fIInterfaceColors\fR section in the color scheme file
.TP
\fB\\l\fR: Print an 'L' if in light mode
.TP
\fB\\P\fR: The current profile name
.TP
\fB\\u\fR: The username
.TP
\fB\\H\fR: The full hostname
.TP
\fB\\h\fR: The hostname, up to the first ‘.’
.TP
\fB\\n\fR: A newline character
.TP
\fB\\r\fR: A carriage return
.TP
\fB\\a\fR: A bell character
.TP
\fB\\d\fR: The date, in abbreviated form (ex: “Tue May 26”)
.TP
\fB\\t\fR: The time, in 24\-hour HH:MM:SS format
.TP
\fB\\T\fR: The time, in 12\-hour HH:MM:SS format
.TP
\fB\\@\fR: The time, in 12\-hour am/pm format
.TP
\fB\\A\fR: The time, in 24\-hour HH:MM format
.TP
\fB\\w\fR: The full current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
.TP
\fB\\W\fR: The basename of $PWD, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
.TP
\fB\\p\fR: A mix of the two above, it abbreviates the current working directory only if longer than PathMax (a value defined in the configuration file).
.TP
\fB\\z\fR: Exit code of the last executed command (colored according to the \fIxs\fR (success) and \fIxf\fR (failure) codes in \fIInterfaceColors\fR in the color scheme file)
.TP
\fB\\$\fR '#', if the effective user ID is 0, and '$' otherwise
.TP
\fB\\nnn\fR: The character whose ASCII code is the octal value nnn
.TP
\fB\\\\\fR: A literal backslash
.TP
\fB\\[\fR: Begin a sequence of non\-printing characters. This is mostly used to add color to the prompt line
.TP
\fB\\]\fR: End a sequence of non\-printing characters
.TP
The following files statistics escape codes are also recognized (not available in light mode):
.TP
\fB\\D\fR: Amount of sub-directories in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\R\fR: Amount of regular files in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\X\fR: Amount of executable files in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\.\fR: Amount of hidden files in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\U\fR: Amount of SUID files in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\G\fR: Amount of SGID files in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\F\fR: Amount of FIFO/pipe files in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\K\fR: Amount of socket files in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\B\fR: Amount of block device files in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\C\fR: Amount of character device files in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\x\fR: Amount of files with capabilities in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\L\fR: Amount of symbolic links in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\o\fR: Amount of broken symbolic links in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\M\fR: Amount of multi-link files in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\E\fR: Amount of files with extended attributes in the current directory.TP
.TP
\fB\\O\fR: Amount of other-writable files in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\"\fR: Amount of files with the sticky bit set in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\?\fR: Amount of files of unknown file type in the current directory
.TP
\fB\\!\fR: Amount of unstatable files in the current directory
.TP
Escape codes for prompt notifications (mostly used for custom prompts which need to handle notifications themselves, in which case \fINotifications\fR should be set to \fIfalse\fR in the color scheme file to prevent automatic insertion of notifications at the left of the prompt):
.TP
\fB\\*\fR: '*' + amount of selected files
.TP
\fB\\%\fR: 'T' + amount of trashed files
.TP
\fB\\#\fR: 'R' if root user
.TP
\fB\\)\fR: 'W' + amount of warning messages
.TP
\fB\\(\fR: 'E' + amount of error messages
.TP
\fB\\=\fR: 'N' + amount of notice messages
.TP
\fBNote\fR: Except for '\\#', nothing is printed if the number is zero.
.TP
By default, for example, \fBclifm\fR's prompt line is this:

\fB"\\[\\e[0m\\][\\S\\[\\e[0m\\]]\\l \\A \\u:\\H \\[\\e[00;36m\\]\\w\\n\\[\\e[0m\\]<\\z\\[\\e[0m\\]>\\[\\e[0;34m\\] \\$\\[\\e[0m\\] "\fR

.TP
which once decoded should look something like this:

 \fB[1] 13:45 user:hostname /my/path
 <0> $\fR
.TP
with the workspace number printed in blue, the path in cyan, the last exit status in green, and the dollar sign in blue.
.TP
A more "classic" prompt could be construed as follows:

 \fB"\\u@\\U \\w> "\fR
.TP
or, using now command substitution:

 \fB"$(whoami)@$(hostname) $(pwd)> "\fR
.TP

\fBAdvanced prompt customization\fR
.TP
Besides commands substitution, which allows you to include in the prompt any information you like via shell scripts or simple shell commands, the use of Unicode characters allows you to build colorful and modern prompts.
.TP
Inserting Unicode characters in the prompt can be made in two ways:
.TP
\fBa)\fR Pasting the character itself using a text editor
.TP
\fBb)\fR Entering the octal code corresponding to the character. Use \fBhexdump\fR(1) as follows to get the appropriate hex code:

 echo -ne "[paste the char here]" | hexdump -c
.TP
The first line of the output will be something along these lines:

 00000000  256 234 356               |...|
.TP
In this case, the octal code is: "256 234 356". So, to insert this Unicode character in the prompt, add it as follows:

 Prompt="... \\256\\234\\356 ..."
.TP
\fBNote\fR: Make sure you have installed a font able to display Unicode characters.
.TP
A few advanced prompt examples can be found in the prompts file.
.TP
\fBA simple use case for the files statistics escape codes\fR
.TP
We all want to keep our systems safe. One of the many ways to get a bit of safety is by checking that there is not file in our file system that could somehow endanger our machines. SUID, SGID, executable, and other-writable files are to be count among these dangers. This is why it could be useful to build a little files scanner for our prompt using the above mentioned files statistics escape codes. This is the code for our scanner:

 \fB\\[\\e[0m\\]\\[\\e[1;31m\\]\\U\\[\\e[0m\\]:\\[\\e[1;33m\\]\\G\\[\\e[0m\\]:
 \\[\\e[1;32m\\]\\O\\[\\e[0m\\]:\\[\\e[1;34m\\]\\X\\[\\e[0m\\]"\fR
.TP
By adding this code to our prompt line, we get something like this:

 \fB24:2:-:2389\fR
.TP
This tells us that in the current directory we have 24 SUID files (printed in bold red), 2 SGID files (bold yellow), no other-writable file, and 2389 executable files.
.TP
\fBNOTE\fR: A predefined prompt with this files scanner integrated can be found in the \fIprompts.clifm\fR file.
.TP
\fBNOTE 2\fR: Most of the information these escape codes rely on depends on \fBstat\fR(3). Now, since \fBstat\fR(3) is not used when running in light mode (for performance reasons), this information won't be available in light mode either.

.TP
\fBPrompt notifications\fR
.TP
A bold red 'R' at the left of the prompt reminds the user that the program is running as root. A bold green asterisk indicates that there are elements in the Selection Box. In the same way, a yellow 'T' means that there are currently files in the trash can, just as a bold blue 'S' means that the program is running in stealth mode. Finally, \fBclifm\fR makes use of three kind of messages: errors (a red 'E' at the left of the prompt), warnings (a yellow 'W'), and simple notices (a green 'N').
.TP
If \fINotifications\fR is set to "false" in the prompts file, the above notifications won't be printed by the prompt, but is still available to the user as escape codes (see above) and environment variables (see the \fBENVIRONMENT\fR section below) to build custom prompts.
.TP
\fBThe Warning Prompt\fR
.TP
The suggestions system includes a secondary, warning prompt, used to highlight wrong/invalid/non-existent command names. Once an invalid command is entered, the regular prompt will be switched to the warning prompt and the whole input line will turn dimmed red (though it can be customized to your liking).
.TP
The wrong command name check is omitted if the input string:

 Is quoted (ex: "string" or 'string')
 Is bracketed (ex: (string), [string], or {string})
 It starts with a stream redirection character (ex: <string or >string)
 Is a comment (ex: #string)
 It starts with one or more spaces
 Is an assignment (ex: foo=var)
 It is escaped (ex: \\string)
.TP
The warning prompt could be customized by means of the same rules used by the regular prompt. To use a custom warning prompt just modify the \fIWarningPrompt\fR line in the prompts file (via the \fIprompt edit\fR command). It defaults to

 \fB"\\[\\e[0m\\]\\[\\e[00;02;31m\\](!) > "\fR
.TP
the last line of the regular prompt will become "\fB(!) > \fR", printed in a dimmed red color, including the input string.
.TP
To change the color of the input text while in the warning prompt use the \fBwp\fR color code (see the \fBCOLOR CODES\fR section above). It defaults to dimmed red, just as the warning prompt itself.
.TP
To disable this feature use the \fI--no-warning-prompt\fR command line switch or set the \fIEnableWarningPrompt\fR option to \fBfalse\fR in the prompts file.
.TP
\fBNOTE\fR: Bear in mind that the warning prompt depends on the suggestions system, so that it won't be available if this system is disabled.
.TP

\fB3. THE DIVIDING LINE\fR
.TP
The line dividing the current list of files and the prompt. It could be customized via the \fIDividingLine\fR option in the color scheme file to fit your prompt design and/or color scheme.
.TP
\fIDividingLine\fR accepts one or more ASCII or Unicode characters (in both cases you only need to type/paste here the chosen character(s)). If only one character is specified (by default, "-"), it will be repeatedly printed to fulfill the current line up to the right edge of the screen or terminal window. If you don't want to cover the whole line, just specify three or more characters, in which case only these characters (and no more) will be used as dividing line. For example: "------->". To use an empty line, set \fIDividingLineChar\fR to "0" (that is, as a character, not as a number). Finally, is this value is not set, a special line drawn with box-drawing characters will be used (box-drawing characters are not supported by all terminal-emulators).
.TP
The color of this line is set via the \fIdl\fR color code in the color scheme file. Consult the \fBCOLOR CODE\fR section above for more information.
.TP
\fB4. FZF WINDOW\fR
Refer to the \fBTAB completion\fR section below.
.TP

.SH 9. BUILT\-IN EXPANSIONS
.TP
\fBThe SEL keyword\fR
.TP
\fBclifm\fR will automatically expand the \fB'sel' keyword\fR: 'sel' indeed amounts to 'file1 file2 file3 ...' In this way, you can use the 'sel' keyword with any command.
.TP
If you want to set the executable bit on several files, for instance, simply select the files you want and then run this command: 'chmod +x sel'. Or, if you want to copy or move several files into some directory: 'cp sel 12', or 'mv sel 12' (provided the ELN 12 corresponds to a directory), respectively.
.TP
If the destiny directory is omitted, selected files are copied into the current working directory, that is to say, 'mv sel' amounts to 'mv sel .'.
.TP
To trash or remove selected files, simply run 'tr sel' or 'rm sel' respectively. The same goes for wildcards and braces: 'chmod +x *', for example, will set the executable bit on all files (excluding hidden files) in the current working directory, while 'chmod +x file{1,2,3}' will do it for file1, file2, and file3 respectively.
.TP
If using the FZF mode for TAB completion (see below), you can operate only on \fIsome\fR selected files as follows: type 'CMD sel' and, without appending any space char, press TAB: the list of selected files will be displayed. Choose one or more of them (use TAB to mark entries) to operate only on those specific files. For example, to print the file properties of some specific selected files: p sel->TAB, select the files you want via TAB, press Enter or Right (marked files will be inserted in the command line), and the press Enter, as usual.
.TP
\fBTAB completion\fR
.TP
There are four modes for TAB completion: \fIstandard\fR (interface provided by readline), \fIfzf\fR, which depends on \fBFZF\fR (\fIhttps://github.com/junegunn/fzf\fR) (version 0.18.0 or later), \fIfzy\fR (\fIhttps://github.com/leo-arch/fzy\fR), and \fIsmenu\fR (\fIhttps://github.com/p-gen/smenu\fR). By default, if the \fIfzf\fR binary is found in \fBPATH\fR, \fBclifm\fR will attempt to use \fIfzf\fR to display completions. You can force the use of the remaining modes via the \fI\-\-std\-tab\-comp\fR, \fI\-\-fzytab\fR, and \fI\-\-smenutab\fR command line switches. The \fITabCompletionMode\fR option in the configuration file can be used to permanently set the TAB completion mode.
.TP
If using the \fIfzf\fR mode, the completions interface can be customized using the \fIFzfTabOptions\fR option in the color scheme file. --height, --margin, +i/-i, --read0, --query, and --ansi will be appended to set up some details of the completions interface. Set this value to \fInone\fR to pass no option, to the empty string to load the default values, or to any other custom value. Unless set to \fInone\fR, any option specified here will override \fBFZF_DEFAULT_OPTS\fR.
.TP
Default values for this option are:
 --color=16,prompt:6,fg+:-1,pointer:4,hl:5,hl+:5,gutter:-1,marker:2 --bind tab:accept,right:accept,left:abort --inline-info --layout=reverse-list
.TP
Consult \fBfzf\fR(1) for more information.
.TP
If set neither in \fIFzfTabOptions\fR nor in \fBFZF_DEFAULT_OPTS\fR (in this order), the height of the FZF window is set to the default value: 40% of the current terminal amount of line/rows.
.TP
To use FZF global values (defined in \fBFZF_DEFAULT_OPTS\fR), just set \fIFzfTabOptions\fR to \fInone\fR.
.TP
If using the \fIsmenu\fR mode, the interface can be customized using the \fBCLIFM_SMENU_OPTIONS\fR environment variable. For example:
.sp
 export CLIFM_SMENU_OPTIONS="\-a t:2,b b:4 c:r ct:2,r sf:6,r st:5,r mt:5,b"
.TP
Consult \fBsmenu\fR(1) for more information.
.TP
For information about how to customize \fIfzy\fR consult \fBfzy\fR(1).
.TP
\fBclifm\fR can perform fuzzy TAB completion (just as suggestions, if enabled) for file names and paths (e.g. 'dwn<TAB>' is completed as 'Downloads'). To enable this feature use the \fI\-\-fuzzy\-match command line switch.
.TP
Besides the default \fITAB completion\fR for command \fBnames and paths\fR, you can also expand \fBELN's\fR using the TAB key. Example: type 'o 12', press TAB, and it becomes 'o filename ', or, if 12 refers to a directory, 'o dir/'. \fBclifm\fR uses a Bash\-style quoting system, so that this file name: "this is a test@version{1}" is expanded as follows: this\\ is\\ a\\ test\\@version\\{1\\}
.TP
ELN's and \fBELN ranges\fR will be also automatically expanded, provided the corresponding ELN's actually exist, that is to say, provided some file name is listed on the screen under those numbers. For example: 'diff 1 118' will only expand '1', but not '118', if there is no ELN 118. In the same way, the range 1\-118 will only be expanded provided there are 118 or more elements listed on the screen.
.TP
Since ranges could be a bit tricky, TAB completion is available to make sure this range actually includes the desired file names.
.TP
If this feature somehow conflicts with the command you want to run, say, 'chmod 644 ...', because the current amount of files is equal or larger than 644 (in which case \fBclifm\fR will expand that number), then you can simply run the command as external: ';chmod 644 ...'
.TP
TAB completion for commands, paths, users home directory, workspaces, wildcards\fB*\fR, file types\fB*\fR, environment variables, bookmarks, profiles, color schemes, file tags, search patterns, commands history, directory history (via the \fIjump\fR command), remote resources, sort methods, ranges\fB*\fR, the 'sel' keyword\fB*\fR, trashed files\fB*\fR, plus the deselect\fB*\fR and the open-with commands (\fIow\fR) is also available. To make use of the bookmarks completion, make sure to specify some name for your bookmarks, since these names are used by the completion function.
.TP
\fB*\fR When using FZF mode for TAB completion, multi-selection is available: Press TAB to expand possible selections, then press TAB again to mark desired entries. Once desired entries are marked, press Enter or the Right arrow key: marked entries will be inserted into the command line. Multi-selection is also available for the following commands, provided there is no slash in the query string: \fIac\fR, \fIad\fR, \fIbb\fR, \fIbr\fR, \fId/dup\fR, \fIp/pr/prop\fR, \fIr\fR, \fIs\fR, \fIt/tr/trash\fR, and \fIte\fR.
.TP
Of course, combinations of all these features is also possible. Example: 'cp sel file* 2 23\-31 .' will copy all selected files, plus all files whose name starts with "file", plus those files corresponding to the ELN's 2, and 23 to 31, into the current working directory.
.TP
In addition to completions and expansions, an \fIauto-suggestions system\fR is also available. See the \fBAUTO-SUGGESTIONS\fR section below.

.SH 10. RESOURCE OPENER
As \fBclifm\fR's built-in resource opener, \fILira\fR takes care of opening files when no opening application has been specified in the command line. It does this by automatically parsing a MIME list file (see the \fBFILES\fR section below): it looks first for a matching pattern (either a MIME type or a file name), then checks the existence of the command associated to this pattern, and finally executes it.
.TP
\fILira\fR is controlled via the \fImime\fR command. File associations are stored in the MIME list file.
.TP
When running for the first time, or whenever the MIME list file cannot be found, \fBclifm\fR will copy the MIME definitions file from the \fBDATADIR\fR directory (usually \fI/usr/share/clifm/mimelist.clifm\fR) to the local configuration directory.
.TP
\fBLira\fR will check the file line by line, and if a matching line is found, and if at least one of the specified applications exists, this application will be used to open the corresponding associated file. Else, the next line will be checked. In other words, the precedence order is top to bottom (for lines) and left to right (for applications).
.TP
\fBNOTE\fR: In case of directories (whose MIME type is \fIinode/directory\fR), the entry will be used \fBonly\fR for the open-with command (\fIow\fR).
.TP
This MIME list file follows a few simple syntax rules:
.TP
Each line in the MIME list file consists of:
.TP
\fBa)\fR 'X' or '!X' to specify GUI and non-GUI environments respectively;
.TP
\fBb)\fR 'N' to instruct \fILira\fR to match a file name instead of a MIME type;
.TP
\fBc)\fR A left value, containing either a file name or a MIME type to be matched. Regular expressions are supported;
.TP
\fBd)\fR A right value, a list of semicolon separated commands (and optionally the commands parameters) to be associated to the corresponding left value;
.TP
Note that the syntax departs here from the Freedesktop specification in that we do not rely on desktop files (mostly used by desktop environments), but rather on commands and parameters. In general thus, the syntax is this:

 [!]X[:N]:REGEX=CMD [ARGS] [%f];CMD [ARGS] [%f]; ...
.TP
Use the \fB%f\fR placeholder to specify the position of the file name to be opened in the command. For example, 'mpv %f --terminal=no' will be translated into 'mpv FILE --terminal=no'. If the placeholder is not specified, the file name will be appended to command string. Thus, this: 'mpv --terminal=no' amounts to this: 'mpv --terminal=no FILE'.
.TP
Running the opening application in the background:
.TP
For GUI applications:

 APP %f &>/dev/null &
.TP
For terminal applications:

 TERM -e APP %f &>/dev/null &
.TP
Replace 'TERM' and 'APP' by the corresponding values. The \fI-e\fR option might vary depending on the terminal emulator used (TERM).
.TP
\fBNOTE\fR: In case of archives, the built-in \fIad\fR command could be used as opening application.
.TP
\fBNOTE 2\fR: Environment variables (e.g. \fB$EDITOR\fR, \fB$VISUAL\fR, \fB$BROWSER\fR, and even \fB$PAGER\fR) are also recognized by \fILira\fR. You can even set custom environment variables to be used exclusively by \fBclifm\fR. For example, you can set \fBCLIFM_TERM\fR, \fBCLIFM_EDITOR\fR, and \fBCLIFM_PDF\fR, and then use them to define some associations:

 X:text/plain=$CLIFM_TERM -e $CLIFM_EDITOR %f &
 X:N:.*\\.pdf$=$CLIFM_PDF %f &
.TP
\fBExamples\fR:
.TP
Match a full file name:

 X:N:some_filename:leafpad;mousepad;kate;gedit
.TP
\fBNote\fR: the 'N' character indicates that this rule is intended to match a \fBfile name\fR instead of a MIME type, just as 'X' means that this rule is aimed to \fBgraphical\fR environments and '!X' that it is aimed rather to \fBnon-graphical\fR environments.
.TP
\fBNote 2\fR: If the file name contains a dot, quote it like this: some_filename\.ext (to prevent the REGEX parser from interpreting the dot)
.TP
Match multiple file names (starting with 'str'):

 X:N:^str.*:leafpad;mousepad;kate;gedit
.TP
Match a single extension:

 X:N:.*\\.txt$:leafpad;mousepad;kate;gedit
 !X:N:.*\\.^txt$:nano;vim;vi;emacs
.TP
Match multiple extensions:
.TP
 X:N:.*\\.(sh|c|py|pl)$:geany;leafpad;nano
.TP
Match single mimetype:

 X:^audio/mp3$=mpv %f --terminal=no;ffplay -nodisp -autoexit;mpv;mplayer
.TP
Match mutiple mimetypes:

 X:^audio/.*=mplayer;mplayer2;vlc;gmplayer;smplayer;totem
.TP
In case of MIME types, you can also write the entire expression without relying on any regular expression. For example:

 !X:text/plain=$TERM -e $EDITOR %f &>/dev/null &
.TP
For more information take a look at the mimelist file itself (\fIF6\fR or \fImm edit\fR).
.TP
\fBUsing \fBclifm\fR as a standalone resource opener\fR
.TP
Thought \fBclifm\fR is a file manager, it can be used as a simple resource opener via the \fI\-\-open\fR command line option. For example:

 clifm --open /path/to/my_file.jpg
 clifm --open /path/to/my_dir
 clifm --open https://some_domain
.TP
\fBNOTE\fR: When opening web resources \fBclifm\fR will query the mimelist file using text/html as MIME type. Whatever association it finds for this specific MIME type will be used to open the web resource.
.TP
Positional parameters could be used as well, provided the parameter does not point to a directory name, in which case it will be used as \fBclifm\fR starting path. For instance:

 clifm /path/to/my_file.jpg
 clifm https://some_domain

.SH 11. AUTO-SUGGESTIONS
\fIGemini\fR is a built-in suggestions system (similar to that provided by the Fish shell). As you type, \fIGemini\fR will suggest possible completions right after the current cursor position.

The following checks are availabe (the order can be customized, see below):
.sp
a. ELN's
.sp
b. \fBclifm\fR commands and parameters (including the \fIsel\fR keyword)
.sp
c. Entries in the command history list (already used commands)
.sp
d. File names in the current working directory
.sp
e. Entries in the jump database
.sp
f. Aliases names
.sp
g. Bookmarks names
.sp
h. Program names in \fBPATH\fR
.sp
i. Shell builtins

\fBNOTE:\fR The shell name is taken from \fI/bin/sh\fR. The following shell are supported: bash, dash, fish, ksh, tcsh, and zsh. Command names are checked in the following order: \fBclifm\fR internal commands, commands in \fBPATH\fR, and shell builtins.

To accept the entire suggestion, just press \fBRight\fR or \fBCtrl-f\fR: the cursor will move to the end of the suggested command and the suggestion color will change to that of the typed text; next, you can press \fBEnter\fR to execute the command as usual. Otherwise, if the suggestion is not accepted, it will be simply ignored and you can continue editing the current command line however you want.

To aceppt the first suggested word only (up to first slash or space), press rather \fBAlt-Right\fR or \fBAlt-f\fR. Not available for ELN's, aliases and bookmarks names.

Bear in mind that suggestions for ELN's, aliases and bookmarks names, and the jump function (invoked by the \fIj\fR command) do not work as the remaining suggestions: they do not suggest possible completions for the current input, but rather the value pointed to by it. For example, if you type "12" and the current list of files includes a file name whose ELN is '12', the file name corresponding to this ELN will be printed next to "12" as follows: \fB12_ > filename\fR (where the underscore is the current cursor position). Press 'Right' or 'Ctrl-f' to accept the suggestion, in which case the text typed so far will be replaced by the suggestion.

The order of the suggestion checks could be customized via the \fISuggestionStrategy\fR option in the configuration file. Each check is assigned a lowercase letter:

 a = Aliases names
 b = Bookmark names
 c = Possible completions
 e = ELN's
 f = Files in the current directory
 h = Entries in the commands history
 j = Entries in the jump database

The value taken by \fISuggestionStrategy\fR is a string of seven(7) characters containing the above letters. The letters order in this string specifies the order in which the suggestion checks will be performed. For example, to perform all checks in the same order above, the value of the string should be \fBabcefhj\fR (without quotes). Or, if you prefer to run the history check first: \fBhabcefj\fR. Finally, you can ignore one or more checks using a dash (-). So, to ignore the bookmarks and aliases checks, set \fISuggestionStrategy\fR to \fBh--cefj\fR. The default value for this option is \fBehfjbac\fR.

\fBNote\fR: The check for program names in \fBPATH\fR is always executed at last, except when the \fIExternalCommands\fR option is disabled, in which case suggestions for them are simply not displayed.

Suggestions will be printed using one of the following color codes (see the \fBCOLOR CODES\fR section above):

\fIsf\fR: Used for file and directory names. This includes suggestions for ELN's, bookmarks names, files in the current directory, and possible completions. Default value: 02;04;36 (dimmed underlined cyan)

\fIsh\fR: Used for entries in the commands history. Default value: 02;35 (dimmed magenta)

\fIsc\fR: Used for aliases and program names in \fBPATH\fR. Default value: 02;31 (dimmed red)

\fIsx\fR: Used for \fBclifm\fR internal commands and parameters. Default value: 02;32 (dimmed green)

\fIsp\fR: Greater-than sign (>) used when suggesting ELN's, bookmarks, and aliases names. Default value: 02;31 (dimmed red)

You can set \fBSuggestFiletypeColor\fR to "true" in the configuration file to use the color of the file type of the current file name (as set in the color scheme file) instead of the value of
\fIsf\fR. For example, if a suggestion is printed for a file that is a symbolic link, \fIln\fR or \fIor\fR (if a broken link) will be used instead of \fIsf\fR.
.sp
\fBNote\fR: Suggestions are disabled for the FreeBSD and the NetBSD default consoles. Take a look at the Wiki for more information.

.SH 12. SHELL FUNCTIONS
\fBclifm\fR includes a few shell functions to perform specific actions (cd-on-quit, file-picker, and subshell-notice). Take a look at the corresponding files, in \fI/usr/share/clifm/functions\fR, and follow the instructions. Needles to say, you can write your own functions.

.SH 13. PLUGINS
Plugins are just scripts or programs (written in any language) aimed to add, extend or improve CliFM's functionalities. They are linked to actions names defined in a dedicated configuration file (\fIXDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/actions.clifm\fR): entering the action name immediately executes the corresponding plugin.

\fBNote\fR: In \fIstealth mode\fR, since access to configuration files is not allowed, plugins are disabled.

Though several plugins are provided at installation time (in the \fIplugins\fR directory), you can write your owns as you like, with any language you like, and for whatever goal you want. Writing plugins is generally quite easy; but your mileage may vary depending on what you are trying to achieve. A good place to start is examining the provide plugins and reading the \fIactions\fR command description, and the \fBENVIRONMENT\fR and \fBFILES\fR sections below.

A convenient helper script is provided to get a consistent look across all plugins, specially those running FZF. This helper script is located in \fIDATADIR/clifm/plugins/plugins-helper\fR, but it will be overridden by \fIXDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/plugins/plugins-helper\fR if found. The location of this file is set by \fBclifm\fR itself in the \fBCLIFM_PLUGINS_HELPER\fR environment variable to be used by plugins. Source the file and use any of the functions and variables provided by it to write a new FZF plugin:

    # Source our plugins helper
    if [ -z "$CLIFM_PLUGINS_HELPER" ] || ! [ -f "$CLIFM_PLUGINS_HELPER" ]; then
        printf "\fBclifm\fR: Unable to find plugins-helper file\\n" >&2
        exit 1
    fi
    # shellcheck source=/dev/null
    . "$CLIFM_PLUGINS_HELPER"

Plugins can talk to CliFM via a dedicated pipe created for this purpose and exposed via an environment variable (\fBCLIFM_BUS\fR). Just write to the pipe and \fBclifm\fR will hear and handle the message immediately after the plugin's execution. If the message is a path, \fBclifm\fR will run the \fIopen\fR function, changing the current directory to the new path, if a directory, or opening it with the \fIresource opener\fR, if a file. Otherwise, if the message is not a path, it will be taken and executed as a command. Examples:

    \'echo "/tmp" > "$CLIFM_BUS"\' tells \fBclifm\fR to change the current directory to /tmp

    \'echo "s *.png" > "$CLIFM_BUS"\' makes \fBclifm\fR select all files in the current directory ending with ".png"

The pipe (\fBCLIFM_BUS\fR) is deleted immediately after the execution of its content and recreated before running any other plugin.

  \fBfile info\fR: exiftool, mediainfo, or file

.TP
To run the \fIpager.sh\fR plugin, for example, you only need to enter the corresponding action name, in this case \fIgg\fR. In case of need, all plugins provide a \fI-h,--help\fR switch for a brief usage description.
.TP
\fBNote\fR: The \fIfzfnav\fR plugin uses \fBfzf\fR(1) to navigate the file system and \fIBFG\fR (a script located in the plugins directory) to show previews (to show files preview \fIBFG\fR requires \fBueberzug\fR to be installed or the Kitty protocol via the Kitty terminal). A configuration file (BFG.cfg, in the plugins directory itlsef) is provided to customize the previewer's behavior.
.TP
In addition to the built-in BFG previewer, \fIfzfnav\fR supports the use of both Ranger's \fIscope.sh\fR script and \fBpistol\fR. To use \fBscope\fR, just edit the \fIBFG\fR configuration file and set USE_SCOPE to 1 and SCOPE_FILE to the correct path to the \fIscope.sh\fR file (normally \fI$HOME/.config/ranger/scope.sh\fR). To use \fBpistol\fR instead, set USE_PISTOL to 1.
.TP
\fBNote 2\fR: The \fIgit_status\fR plugin is not intended to be used as a normal plugin, that is, executed via an action name, but rather to be executed as a prompt command:

 promptcmd /usr/share/clifm/plugins/git_status.sh
.TP
Whereas this plugin provides basic Git integration, it could be easily modified (it is just a few lines long) to include whatever git function you might need.
.TP
Take a look at the Wiki for more information: \fIhttps://github.com/clifm/wiki/Advanced#plugins\fR

.SH 14. AUTOCOMMANDS
Heavily inspired by \fBVifm\fR, the \fIautocommands\fR function allows the user a fine-grained control over \fBclifm\fR settings. It is mostly devised as a way to improve performance for remote file systems (usually slower than local ones) by allowing you to turn off some features (like the files counter) that might greatly affect performance under some circumstances (like remote connections). However, this function is not restricted to this use: use it for whatever purpose you find useful.
.sp
Add a line preceded by the \fIautocmd\fR keyword to the config file. The general syntax is: \fBautocmd PATTERN cmd,cmd,cmd\fR
.sp
\fBPATTERN\fR is a glob expression to match directory names. If no glob metacharacter is provided, the string will be compared as is to the current working directory. To invert the meaning of a pattern, prepend an exclamation mark: \fB!PATTERN\fR
.sp
\fBPATTERN\fR is followed by a comma separated list of commands:
.sp
\fB!CMD\fR: The exclamation mark allows you to run shell commands, custom binaries or scripts
.sp
The following codes are used to control \fBclifm\fR's files list:
.sp
 \fBCode   Description           Example\fR
 \fBcs\fR     Color scheme          cs=zenburn
 \fBfc\fR     Files counter         fc=0
 \fBhf\fR     Hidden files          hf=0
 \fBlm\fR     Light mode            lm=1
 \fBlv\fR     Long/detail view      lv=0
 \fBmf\fR     Max files             mf=100
 \fBmn\fR     Max file name length  mn=20
 \fBod\fR     Only directories      od=1
 \fBpg\fR     Pager                 pg=0
 \fBst\fR     Sort method           st=5
 \fBsr\fR     Reverse sort          sr=1
.sp
A few example lines:
.sp
 \fB1.\fR Run in light mode and disable the files counter for the remotes directory:
    autocmd /media/remotes/** lm=1,fc=0

 \fB2.\fR Just a friendly reminder:
    autcomd ~/important !printf "Important: keep your fingers outta here!\\n" && read \-n1

 \fB3.\fR This directory has thousands of files. Show only the first hundred and enable the pager:
    autocmd /usr/bin mf=100,pg=1

 \fB4.\fR Lots of media files (with large file names). Trim file names to 20 chars max and  run the files previewer:
    autocmd ~/Downloads mn=20,!~/.config/clifm/plugins/fzfnav.sh

 \fB5.\fR Mmm, just because I can. Be creative!
    autocmd /home/user hf=0,cs=nord,lv=1
    autocmd / lv=1,fc=0,cs=solarized,st=5

.sp
The first example is the recommended configuration for directories containing remote file systems
.sp
As seen in the fifth example, plugins could be used here as well: in this case, we want to run \fIfzfnav\fR (to make use of the files preview capability) whenever we enter into the \fIDownloads\fR directory, usually containing videos, music, and images.
.sp
\fBNOTE\fR: If you decide to use a plugin, bear in mind that it won't be able to communicate with \fBclifm\fR, because autocommands always executes commands as external applications using the system shell.
.sp
Autocommand files: \fI.cfm.in\fR and \fI.cfm.out\fR
.sp
Two files are specifically checked by the autocommands function: \fI.cfm.in\fR and \fI.cfm.out\fR.
.sp
The content of these files is a single instruction, either a shell command or, if you need more elaborated stuff, a script (or custom binary). Note that codes to modify \fBclifm\fR's settings (as described above) are not available here.
.sp
If a directory contains a file named \fI.cfm.in\fR, \fBclifm\fR will execute (via the system shell) its content when \fBentering\fR this directory (before listing files). If the file is named rather \fI.cfm.out\fR, its content will be executed immediately after \fBleaving\fR this directory (and before listing the new directory's content).
.sp
For example, if you want a simple notification whenever you enter or leave your home directory, just create both \fI.cfm.in\fR and \fI.cfm.out\fR files in the home directory with the following content:
.sp
For \fI.cfm.in\fR:
   printf "Entering %s ...\\n" "$PWD"
.sp
For \fI.cfm.out\fR:
   printf "Leaving %s ...\\n" "$OLDPWD"

.SH 15. FILE TAGS
.sp
\fIEtiqueta\fR is \fBclifm\fR's built-in files tagging system
.sp
\fB1. How Etiqueta works?\fR
.sp
File tags are created via symlinks using an specific directory under the user's profile: \fI${XDG_CONFIG_DIR:-/home/USER/.config}/clifm/profiles/USER/tags\fR
.sp
Every time a new tag is created, a new directory named as the tag itself is created in the tags directory. Tagged files are just symbolic links to the actual files created in the appropriate directory. For example, if you tag \fI~/myfile.txt\fR as \fIwork\fR, a symbolic link to \fI~/myfile.txt\fR, named \fImyfile.txt\fR will be created in \fItags/work\fR.
.sp
\fB2. Handling file tags\fR
.sp
\fItag\fR is the main \fBEtiqueta\fR command and is used to handle file tags. Its syntax is as follows:

 tag [ls, list] [new] [rm, remove] [mv, rename] [untag] [merge] [FILE]... [[:]TAG]

NOTE: the \fI:TAG\fR notation is used for commands taking both file and tag names: 'tag FILES(s) :TAG ...', to tag files, and 'tag untag :TAG file1 file2', to untag files. Otherwise, \fITAG\fR is used (without the leading colon). For example: '\fItag new docs\fR', to create a new tag named \fIdocs\fR, or 'tag remove png', to delete the tag named \fIpng\fR.
.sp
The following command shortcuts are available:
 \fBta\fR    Tag files
 \fBtd\fR    Delete tag(s)
 \fBtl\fR    List tags or tagged files
 \fBtm\fR    Rename (mv) tag
 \fBtn\fR    Create new tag(s)
 \fBtu\fR    Untag file(s)
 \fBty\fR    Merge two tags
.sp
\fB3. Usage examples\fR
.sp
- List available tags:

 \fBtl\fR
.sp
- Tag all .PNG files in the current directory as both \fIimages\fR and \fIpng\fR:

 \fBta *.png :images :png\fR
.sp
\fBNOTE\fR: Tags are created if they do not exist
.sp
- Tag all selected files as \fIspecial\fR:

 \fBta sel :special\fR
.sp
- List all files tagged as work and all files tagged as \fIdocuments\fR:

 \fBtl work documents\fR
.sp
- Rename the tag \fIdocuments\fR as \fIdocs\fR:

 \fBtm documents docs\fR
.sp
- Merge the tag \fIpng\fR into \fIimages\fR:

 \fBty png images\fR
.sp
\fBNOTE\fR: All files tagged as \fIpng\fR will be now tagged as \fIimage\fRs, and the \fIpng\fR tag will be removed.
.sp
- Remove the tag \fIimages\fR (untag all files tagged as \fIimages\fR):

 \fBtd images\fR
.sp
- Untag a few files from the \fIwork\fR:

 \fBtu :work file1 image.png dir2\fR
.sp
\fBNOTE\fR: TAB completion is available to complete tagged files. If using the FZF mode, multi-selection is also available via the TAB key.
.sp
\fB4. Operating on tagged files\fR
.sp
The \fIt:TAG\fR construct (or tag expression) is used to operate on tagged files via any command, be it internal or external. A few examples:
.sp
- Print the file properties of all files tagged as \fIdocs\fR:

 \fBp t:docs\fR
.sp
\fBNOTE\fR: TAB completion is available to expand tag expressions into one or more of the corresponding tagged files. If using the FZF mode, multi-selection is also available via the TAB key.
.sp
- Remove all files tagged as \fIimages\fR:

 \fBr t:images\fR
.sp
- Run \fBstat\fR(1) over all files tagged as \fIwork\fR and all files tagged as \fIdocs\fR:

 \fBstat t:work t:docs\fR
.sp
\fB4.1 Operating on \fIspecific\fB tagged files\fR
.sp
\fBNOTE\fR: This feature, as always when multi-selection is involved, is only available when TAB completion mode is set to FZF. See the \fBTAB completion\fR subsection of the \fBBUILT-IN-EXPANSIONS\fR section above.
.sp
You might not want to operate on \fBall\fR files tagged as some specific tag, say \fIwork\fR, but rather on \fBsome\fR files tagged as \fIwork\fR. TAB completion is used to achieve this aim.
.sp
Let's suppose you have a tag named \fIwork\fR which contains ten tagged files, but you need to operate (say, print the file properties) only on two of them, say, \fIwork1.odt\fR and \fIwork2.odt\fR:
.sp
 \fBp t:work<TAB>\fR

The list of files tagged as \fIwork\fR will be displayed via FZF. Now just mark the two files you need using \fBTAB\fR, press \fBEnter\fR or \fBRight\fR, and the full path to both files will be inserted into the command line. So, '\fBp t:work\fR' will be replaced by '\fBp /path/to/work1.odt /path/to/work2.odt\fR'.

.SH 16. VIRTUAL DIRECTORIES
CliFM is able to read and list files from the standard input stream (STDIN). Each file in the list should be an absolute path, terminated with a new line character (\\n) and stripped from extra characters not belonging to the path itself. The size of the input stream buffer is 262MiB (65536 paths, provided each path takes PATH_MAX bytes (4096 by default)).
.sp
Each file passed via standard input is stored as a symbolic link pointing to the original file in a temporary directory (called here virtual directory) with read-only (0500) permissions. This directory, and all its contents, will be deleted at program exit. Use the \fI\-\-virtual\-dir\fR command line flag to specify a custom directory (it if does not exist, it will be created) instead of the default one, created in the system temporary directory (usually \fI/tmp/clifm/USER/vdir.XXXXXX\fR, where XXXXXX is a random six digits string).
.sp
The user can operate on these files as if they were any other regular file, since \fBall operations performed on these symbolic links\fR (provided the current working directory is the virtual directory where all these files are stored) \fBare performed on the target files and NOT on the symbolic links themselves\fR.
.sp
Once in the virtual directory, files are listed by default using only the base name of the target file. For example, if the target file is \fI/home/user/Downloads/myfile.tar.gz\fR, this file will be listed as \fImyfile.tar.gz\fR. If this file already exists in the virtual directory (because there is another target file with the same base name, say, \fI/home/user/Documents/tars/myfile.tar.gz\fR), a random six digits suffix will be appended to the file (for instance, \fImyfile.tar.gz.12Rgj6\fR).
.sp
Since this listing mode does not allow the user to get a clear idea of the actual location of each listed file, a keybinding (by default \fIAlt-w\fR) is available to toggle short (base names only) and long file names: in this latter case, file names are listed using the full path to the target file, replacing slashes by colons (:). For example, if the target file is \fI/home/user/Downloads/myfile.tar.gz\fR, it will be listed in the virtual directory as \fIhome:user:Downloads:myfile.tar.gz\fR.
.sp
If you prefer the long names approach, you can use the \fI--virtual-dir-full-paths\fR command line flag.
.sp
\fBNote\fR: Bear in mind that the restore last path function is disabled when listing in this way.
.sp
CliFM provides to ways of using virtual directories:
.sp
\fB1\fR. Reading files from the standard input
.sp
\fB2\fR. Listing sets of files via the \fIvirtualize.sh\fR plugin (which is in fact a special use case of point 1)
.sp
\fB1. Standard input\fR
.sp
Examples:

\fBls -Ad /var/* | clifm\fR

This command will pass all files in the directory \fI/var\fR to CliFM
.sp
If you need to perform more specific queries, you can use \fBfind\fR(1) as follows:

\fBfind -maxdepth 1 -size +500k -print0 | tr '\0' '\n' | sed 's/\.\///g' | clifm\fR

The above command will pass all files in the current directory bigger than 500KiB to CliFM.
.sp
You can also use stream redirection:

\fBls -Ad $PWD/* > list.txt
 clifm < list.txt\fR
.sp
\fB2. The virtualization plugin\fR
.sp
The \fIvirtualize.sh\fR plugin, bound by default to the \fIvt\fR action name, is intended to provide an easy way of listing sets or collections of files, such as selected, tagged, or bookmarked files. For example, to send all selected files to a virtual directory, you can issue this command:

\fBvt sel\fR
.sp
and, if you want rather files tagged as PDF:

\fBvt t:PDF\fR
.sp
Of course, individual files can also be used:

\fBvt file1 file2 file3\fR
.sp
Once executed, the vt plugin will launch a new instance of CliFM (on a new terminal emulator window) where you can operate on the specified files as if they were just normal files. Once done, quit this new instance (via the \fIq\fR command) to return to the primary instance of CliFM.
.sp
\fBNote\fR: By default, the terminal emulator used is \fBxterm\fR(1), but can easily be customized by just editing the plugin script (\fIvirtualize.sh\fR).
.sp
If navigating the file system, you can quickly go back to the virtual directory using the \fI\-d\fR option: \fIvt -d\fR. The navigation keys (see the \fBKEYBOARD SHORTCUTS\fR section above) and the \fBCLIFM_VIRTUAL_DIR\fR environment variable are also available (\fIShift\-Left\fR/\fIShift\-Right\fR or \fRcd $CLIFM_VIRTUAL_DIR\fR).
.sp
\fBTip\fR: Write an alias to make this even easier:
.sp
\fBalias vtd='cd $CLIFM_VIRTUAL_DIR'\fR

.SH 17. NOTE ON SPEED
\fBclifm\fR is by itself quite fast by default, but if speed is still an issue, it is possible to get some extra performance.
.sp
The two most time consuming features are:

 \fB1)\fR The files counter, used to print the amount of files contained by listed directories. Disabling this option produces a nice performance boost.

 \fB2)\fR In normal mode, \fBfstatat\fR(3) is used to gather information about listed files. Since this function, especially when executed hundreds (and even thousands) of times, is quite time consuming, the \fIlight mode\fR was implemented as an alternative listing process omitting all calls to it.
.sp
When running in light mode, however, a few features are lost:
.sp
 1. Only basic file classification is performed, namely, that provided by the \fId_type\fR field of a dirent struct (see \fBreaddir\fR(3)). Bear in mind, nonetheless, that whenever _DIRENT_HAVE_D_TYPE was not set at compile time, or in case of a DT_UNKNOWN value for a given entry (we might be facing a file system not returning the \fId_type\fR value, for example, loop devices), \fBclifm\fR will fall back to \fBstat\fR(3) to get basic files classification.
.sp
 2. Color per file extension is disabled for performance reasons.
.sp
 3. The marker for selected files (*) is lost as well: to keep track of selected files and thus recognize them in the current list of files, we make use of files device and inode number, which is provided by \fBfstatat(3)\fR.
.sp
Besides these two features, a few more things can be disabled to get some extra speed (though perhaps unnoticeable): icons (if enabled), columns, colors, and, if already running without colors, file type indicators. Because listing lots of files could be expensive and time consuming, you can also try to limit the amount of files printed for each visited directory (see the \fImf\fR command above).
.sp
Despite the above, however, it is important to bear in mind that listing speed does not only depend on the program's code and enabled features, but also on the terminal emulator used. Old, basic terminal emulators like Xterm, Aterm, and the kernel built-in console are really slow compared to more modern ones like Urxvt, Lxterminal, ST, and Terminator, to name just a few.
.sp
If using Xterm, a nice speed boost is provided by the fast scroll option: set \fIfastScroll\fR to true in your \fI~/.Xresources\fR file. See \fBxterm\fR(1).

.SH 18. KANGAROO FRECENCY ALGORITHM
The directory jumper function is designed to learn the navigation habits of the user. The information is stored in a database (see the \fBFILES\fR section below) used to get the best match for a given string provided by the user. In this sense, Kangaroo is like a quick, smart, and evolved cd function.
.sp
The information stored in the database, always per directory, is:
 a) Number of visits
 b) Date of first visit (seconds since the Unix epoch)
 c) Date of the last visit
 d) The full path to each visited directory
.sp
With this information it is possible to construct a ranking of directories to offer the user the most accurate matches for each query string. The matching algorithm takes into account mainly two factors: frequency and recency (which is why this kind of algorithm is often called a \fBfrecency\fR algorithm).
.sp
After getting an initial list of matches based on the query string(s) entered by the user, the frequency algorithm is applied on each entry in the list. The algorithm is quite simple: \fB(visits * 100) / days-since-first-visit\fR. As a result, we get the average of visits per day since the day of the first visit (what we call the directory rank).
.sp
There are however some further steps in the ranking process: \fBBonus points\fR.
.sp
Extra credits or penalties are assigned based on the directories \fBlast access time\fR according to the following simple algorithms:
 Within last hour:	rank * 4
 Within last day:	rank * 2
 Within last week:	rank / 2
 More than a week:	rank / 4
.sp
If the last query string matches the \fBbasename\fR of a directory, the entry for this directory has 300 extra credits. This is done simply because we normally use directory basenames as query strings: they are easier to remember.
.sp
In the same way, \fBpinned\fR directories get 1000 extra credits, \fBbookmarked directories\fR 500 credits, and directories currently in a \fBworkspace\fR 300 credits.
.sp
For example: if the query string is "test", /media/data/test will be matched. Now, if this directory was accessed within the last hour, and its rank was 200, it becomes 800. But, because the search string matches its basename, it gets 300 extra credits, and, if this directory is in addition bookmarked and pinned, it gets 1500 extra credits. In this way the total rank of this directory in the matching process is 2600. In doing this, we have more chances of matching what the user actually wanted to match.
.sp
Once all entries in the initial list of matches have been filtered via the above procedure and ranked, we can return the best ranked entry. The higher rank a directory has, the more priority it has over the remaining entries in the initial list of matches.
.sp
Automatic maintenance is done on the database applying a few simple procedures:

 a) Each entry in the database is checked at startup to remove non-existent directories.

 b) Once the rank of a directory falls below MinJumpRank (by default 10), it is forgotten and deleted from the database. The MinJumpRank value can be customized in the configuration file. To make non-frequently visited directories disappear quicker from the database, increase this value.

 c) Once the sum total of ranks reaches MaxJumpTotalRank (by default 100000), each individual rank is divided by a dynamic factor so that the total rank becomes less than or equal to MaxJumpTotalRank. If some rank falls in the process below MinJumpRank, it is removed from the database. MaxJumpTotalRank can be modified in the configuration file. The higher the value of MaxJumpTotalRank, the more time directories will be kept in the database.

NOTE: Directories visited in the last 24 hours will not be removed from the database, no matter what their rank is.
.sp
The idea of 'frecency' was, as far as I know, first devised and designed by Mozilla. See \fIhttps://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Mconnor/Past/PlacesFrecency\fR. However, it is also implemented, though using different algorithms, by different projects like \fBautojump\fR, \fBz.lua\fR, and \fBzoxide\fR.

.SH 20. SECURITY
Since \fBclifm\fR executes OS commands, it needs to provide a way to securely run these commands, specially when it comes to untrusted environments. Two features are provided to achieve this aim: \fBsecure environment\fR and \fBsecure commands\fR.
.TP
Both features are aimed to protect the program and the system as such from malicious input, either coming from environment variables or from indirect input, that is to say, input coming not from the command line (in which is assumed that it is the user herself who is executing the given command), but from files: this is the case of default associated applications (the \fImime\fR command), autocommands, (un)mount commands (via the \fInet\fR command), just as profile and prompt commands.
.TP
In an untrusted environment, an attacker could cause unexpected and insecure behavior (even command injection) using environment variables, or inject malicious commands via indirect input, commands which will be later executed by \fBclifm\fR without the user's consent (i.e. automatically). This is why we provide a mechanism to minimize this danger: if running in an untrusted environment, the secure environment and secure commands features are there to prevent (at least as far as possible) this kind of attacks.
.TP
\fBA) Secure environment\fR
.TP
Programs inherit the environment from the parent process. However, if this inherited environment is not trusted, not secure, it is always a good idea to sanitize it using only sane values, preventing thus undesired and uncontrolled input that might endanger the program and the system itself.
.TP
The \fIsecure\-environment\fR function forces \fBclifm\fR to run on a such a sanitized environment.
.TP
There are two secure\-environment modes, the \fIregular\fR, and the \fIfull\fR one. To enable the regular mode, run \fBclifm\fR with the \fI\-\-secure\-env\fR command line option. Otherwise, enable the full mode using \fI\-\-secure\-env-full\fR.
.TP
\fBa)\fR \fIRegular\fR: in this mode, the inherited environment is cleared, though a few variables are preserved to keep \fBclifm\fR running as stable as possible. These preserved variables are: \fBTERM\fR, \fBDISPLAY\fR, \fBLANG\fR, \fBTZ\fR, and, if FZF TAB completion mode is enabled, \fBFZF_DEFAULT_OPTS\fR.
.TP
The following variables are set in an environment agnostic way (that is, securely):
  \- \fBHOME\fR, \fBSHELL\fR, and \fBUSER\fR are retrieved using \fBgetpwuid(3)\fR
  \- \fBPATH\fR is set consulting \fB_PATH_STDPATH\fR (or \fB_CS_PATH\fR if the former is not available)
  \- \fBIFS\fR is set to a sane, hard\-coded value: " \\n\\t"
.TP
\fBb)\fR \fIFull\fR: this mode is just like the regular mode, except that nothing is imported from the environment at all and only \fBPATH\fR and \fBIFS\fR are set (as described above). Everything else remains unset, and is the user's responsibility to set environment variables (via the export function), as needed. In this case, you might want to set, at least, \fBTERM\fR, and, if running in a graphical environment, \fBDISPLAY\fR.
.TP
Be aware that enabling secure-environment might break some functions, depending on the system configuration.
.TP
\fBB) Secure commands\fR
.TP
Some commands are automatically executed by \fBclifm\fR: (un)mount commands (via the \fInet\fR command), opening applications (via \fILira\fR), just as prompt, profile, and autocommands. These commands are read from a configuration file and then executed. Now, if an attacker has access to any of these files, she might force \fBclifm\fR to run any arbitrary command, and thereby possibly exposing the whole system.
.TP
Every time a command is thus automatically executed via the system shell (i.e. without the user's direct consent), the secure commands function performs three different, though intrinsically related tasks aimed to mitigate command injection and/or unexpected behavior:
.TP
\fBa)\fR Only command base names are allowed: \fInano\fR, for instance, is allowed, while \fI/usr/bin/nano\fR is not. In this way we can guarantee that only commands found in a sanitized \fBPATH\fR (see the point \fBc\fR below) will be executed. This is done in order to prevent the execution of custom binaries/scripts, for example: \fI/tmp/exec_file\fR.
.TP
\fBb)\fR Commands are validated using a \fBwhitelist\fR of safe characters (mostly to prevent stream redirection, conditional execution, and so on, for example, 'your_command;some_injected_command'). This set of safe characters slightly vary depending on the command being executed (because they use different syntaxes):
.sp
 Net command:                   a\-zA\-Z \-_.,/=
 Prompt, profile, autocommands: a\-zA\-Z \-_.,/"'
 Mime command:                  a\-zA\-Z \-_.,%&
.TP
Commands containing \fIat least one\fR unsafe character will be rejected. Of course, we cannot (and should not) prevent what looks like legitimate, benign commands from being executed. But we can stop commands that, in an untrusted environment, look suspicious. This is specially the case of stream redirection (>), pipes (|), sequential (;) and conditional execution (&&, ||), command substitution ($(cmd)), and environment variables ($VAR).
.TP
\fBc)\fR Unless already running in a secure environment (via the \fI\-\-secure\-env\fR or \fI\-\-secure\-env\-full\fR options), a sanitized environment will be created for the command to be executed (returning afterwards to the original environment). The values for this secure environment are as follows:
.sp
 \fBPATH\fR               Taken from \fB_PATH_STDPATH\fR (or \fB_CS_PATH\fR)
 \fBIFS\fR                " \\t\\n"
 \fBUSER\fR, \fBHOME\fR, \fBSHELL\fR  Retrieved from the password database via \fBgetpwuid(3)\fR
 \fBLOGNAME\fR            Same as \fBUSER\fR
 \fBDISPLAY\fR, \fBTZ\fR, \fBLANG\fR, \fBTERM\fR Imported from the environment and sanitized
 \fBLC_ALL\fR             Same as \fBLANG\fR

.SH 21. MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
.sp
\fBSequential and conditional execution of commands\fR:

For each of the internal commands (see the \fBCOMMANDS\fR section above) you can use the semicolon to execute them sequentially and/or the double ampersand to execute them conditionally. Example: \fIcmd1;\ cmd2\ &&\ cmd3\fR.
.sp
Though you can use here external commands as well, bear in mind that, whenever at least one internal command is involved in a chained list of commands, \fBclifm\fR will take care of executing this list (simply because the system shell isn't able to understand any of these commands), so that no shell inter\-process function (like pipes), nor any stream redirection or shell expression (like IF blocks or FOR loops) will be available. However, the shell is still used to run single external commands found in the chained list, but in isolation from the remaining commands in this list.
.sp
As a rule of thumb, when using chained commands make sure to always expand ELN's to avoid undesired consequences. If, for instance, you issue this command: \fItouch\ aaa\ &&\ r\ 3\fR, you will end up deleting a file you were not intended to delete, simple because after the successful execution of the first command, the ELN 3 corresponds now to a different file.
.sp

\fBExternal commands\fR:

\fBclifm\fR is not limited to its own set of internal commands, like open, sel, trash, etc., but it can run any external command as well, provided external commands are allowed (see the \fI\-x\fR option, the \fIext\fR command, or the configuration file). By beginning the external command by a colon or a semicolon (':', ';') you tell \fBclifm\fR not to parse the input string, but instead letting this task to the system shell. However, bear in mind that \fBclifm\fR is not intended to be used as a shell, but as the file manager it is.
.sp

\fBTerminal emulators and non-ASCII characters\fR:

It depends on the terminal emulator you use to correctly display non\-ASCII characters and characters from the extended ASCII charset. If, for example, you create a file named "ñandú" (the Spanish word for 'rhea'), it will be correctly displayed by the Linux console, Lxterminal, and Urxvt, but not thus by Xterm or Aterm.
.sp

\fB.Xresources\fR:

\fBclifm\fR will create \fI$HOME/.Xresources\fR, if it doesn't already exist, for keybindings to work correctly. However, some (and even all) of these keybindings might not work in some terminals, though they do work fine on the console (TTY), xvt\-like terminal emulators like Urxvt and Aterm, and xterm\-like ones. However, keybinding can be edited freely to make them work on any terminal emulator.
.sp

\fBSpaces and escape codes\fR:

When dealing with file names containing spaces, you can use both single and double quotes (ex: "this file" or 'this file') plus escape sequences (ex: this\\ file).
.sp

\fBStarting path\fR:

By default, \fBclifm\fR starts in the current working directory. However, you can always specify a different path by passing it as positional parameter. Ex: clifm /home/user/misc. You can also permanently set up the starting path in the \fBclifm\fR configuration file. If the RestoreLastPath option is set to true, \fBclifm\fR will start instead in the last visited directory (and in the last used workspace), unless the starting path (and optionally the workspace number) is specified via command line.
.sp

\fBDefault profile\fR:

\fBclifm\fR's default profile is "default". To create alternative profiles use the \-P command line option or the 'pf add' command (see above).

.SH 22. FILES
.TP
.B CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/clifmrc\fR. It will be copied from \fIDATADIR/clifm\fR (usually \fI/usr/local/share/clifm\fR), and if not found, it will be created anew with default values. Here you can permanently set up \fBclifm\fR options, define aliases, prompt commands, and autocommands.
.sp
A description for each option in the configuration file can be found in the configuration file itself.
.TP
.B PROFILE FILE
The profile file is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/profile.clifm\fR.
In this file you can add those commands you want to be executed at startup. You can also permanently set here some custom variables, ex: 'dir="/path/to/dir"'. This variable may be used as a shortcut to that directory, for instance: 'cd $dir'. Custom variables could also be temporarily defined via the command prompt: Ex: user@hostname ~ $ var="This is a test". Temporary variables will be removed at program exit.
.TP
.B PROMPTS FILE
This file contains prompts definitions and is located in \fIDATADIR/clifm/prompts.clifm\fR. It will be copied automatically into \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/prompts.clifm\fR if it doesn't exist. The \fIPrompt\fR line in the color scheme file should point to one of the prompt names defined in this file. See the \fBPROMPT\fR section for more information.
.TP
.B KEYBINDINGS FILE
The keybindings file is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/keybindings,cfm\fR. It will be copied from \fIDATADIR/clifm\fR (usually \fI/usr/share/clifm\fR), and if not found, it will be created anew with default values. This file is used to specify the keyboard shortcuts used for some ClifM's functions. The format for each keybinding is always "keyseq:function", where 'keyseq' is an escape sequence in GNU emacs style. A more detailed explanation can be found in the keybindings file itself.
.TP
.B PLUGINS DIRECTORY
The directory used to store programs or scripts pointed to by actions (in other words, plugins) is \fIDATADIR/clifm/plugins\fR (usually \fI/usr/share/clifm/plugins\fR). To edit these plugins copy them to \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/plugins\fR and edit them to your liking. Plugins in this local directory take precedence over those in the system one.
.TP
.B COLORS DIRECTORY
This directory, \fI$DATADIR/clifm/colors\fR, contains available color schemes (or just themes) as files with a \fI.clifm\fR extension. You can copy these themes to the local colors directory (\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/colors\fR) and edit them to your liking (or just create new themes from the ground up). Themes in the local colors directory take precedence over those in the system directory. You can create as many themes as you want by just dropping them into the local colors directory. The default color scheme file (\fIdefault.clifm\fR) can be used as a guide.
.TP
.B ACTIONS FILE
The file used to define custom actions is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/actions.clifm\fR. It will be copied from \fIDATADIR/clifm\fR (usually \fI/usr/share/clifm\fR), and if not found, it will be created anew with default values.
.TP
.B MIMELIST FILE:
The mime list file is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/mimelist.clifm\fR. It is a list of file types and file extensions and their associated applications used by \fIlira\fR. It will be copied from \fIDATADIR/clifm\fR (usually \fI/usr/share/clifm\fR).
.TP
.B BOOKMARKS FILE
The bookmarks file is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/bookmarks.clifm\fR
Just the list of the user's bookmarks used by the bookmarks function.
.TP
.SH HISTORY FILE
The history file is \fI~/.config/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/history.clifm\fR.
A list of commands entered by the user and used by the history function.
.TP
.B LOG FILE
The log file is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/log.clifm\fR.
This file contains CliFM's logs. There are two kinds of logs: 1. messages, and 2. commands.
.sp
Message logs are a record of errors and warnings and have the following form: "m:[date] msg". Enable these logs using the \fILogs\fR option in the configuration file, the \fI\-\-enable\-logs\fR flag, or the \fIlog\fR command.
.sp
Command logs keep track of external commands and internal commands able to modify the filesystem. These logs have this form: "c:[date] current_working_directory:cmd". Enable these logs via the \fICmdLogs\fR option in the configuration file.
.TP
.B KANGAROO DATABASE
The directory jumper database is stored in \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/jump.clifm\fR.
.TP
\fBNOTE\fR: If \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR is not set, \fI$HOME/.config/\fR is used instead.

.SH EXIT STATUS
\fBclifm\fR returns the exit status of the last executed command

.SH CONFORMING TO
\fBclifm\fR is C99 compliant, and, if compiled with the _BE_POSIX flag, it is POSIX.1-2008 compliant as well. If not, just a single non-POSIX function is used: \fBstatx\fR(2) (Linux specific), to get files birth time.
