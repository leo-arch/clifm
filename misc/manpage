.SH 1. GETTING HELP
There are several ways of getting help in CliFM. Once in the program, enter '\fB?\fR' to see a minimal list of options, commands, and keybindings, or press \fBF1\fR to access this manpage, \fBF2\fR to go to the \fBCOMMANDS\fR section of this very manpage, or \fBF3\fR to go to the \fBKEYBOARD SHORTCUTS\fR section.
.sp
A convenient way of getting full information about CliFM commands is via the '\fBih\fR' action, bound by default to the interactive help plugin (\fIihelp.sh\fR). Just type 'ih' to run the plugin (it depends on \fIFZF\fR) and select the command you want to obtain information about.
.sp
For a quick introduction jump to the \fBEXAMPLES\fR section at the bottom of this document.

.SH 3. DESCRIPTION
CliFM is a \fBC\fRommand \fBL\fRine \fBI\fRnterface \fBF\fRile \fBM\fRanager. This is its main feature and strength: all input and interacion is performed via commands typed in a prompt.
.sp
Unlike most terminal file managers out there, indeed, CliFM replaces the traditional TUI interface (also known as curses or text-menu based interface) by a simple command-line interface. In this sense, it is a file manager, but also \fBa shell extension\fR: search for files, copy, rename, and trash some of them, but, at the same time, update/upgrade your system, add some cronjob, stop a service, and run nano (or vi, or emacs, if you like).
.sp
Simply put, with CliFM the command-line is still there, never hidden, but enriched with file management oriented functionalities.

.SH 3. Features
CliFM is a completely text\-based, \fBshell\-like\fR file manager for the terminal able to perform all the basic operations you may expect from any other FM. However, its most distinguishing characteristics are:
.sp
  \fBa)\fR An extensive and customizable list of \fBcolor codes\fR to easily identify file types and extensions.
.sp
  \fBb)\fR The use of \fBshort (and even one\-character) commands\fR, and \fBentry list numbers (ELN's)\fR instead of file names. Enter 'o 12', for instance, to open a file with your default text editor or to change to the desired directory. If the \fBautocd\fR and \fBauto-open\fR functions are enabled, which is the default (see below \fIac\fR and \fIad\fR commands), you only need to enter the ELN to open the file or change to directory: instead of 'o 12', just enter '12'.
.sp
With the \fBautomatic ELN expansion\fR feature you can use ELN's with external commands as well. 'diff 12 5', for example, will run 'diff' over the files corresponding to ELN's 12 and 5. \fBRanges\fR are also accepted, for example: 'rm 1\-12' or 'r 1\-12'. Since numbers could be a bit tricky when it comes to listed files, \fBTAB completion\fR is available for ELN's, just as for commands, paths, profiles, and bookmarks. \fIGemini\fR, a powerful \fBauto-suggestions\fR system (heavily inspired by the Fish shell), was developed with this very purpose in mind.
.sp
  \fBc)\fR \fBAutomatic files listing\fR: Unlike the shell 'cd' command, CliFM's built\-in \fIcd\fR function automatically lists files in the new directory.
.sp
  \fBd)\fR \fBFish\-like auto\-suggestions\fR that, together with TAB completion and history (for both commands and visited directories) assists the user when it comes to typing commands. 
.sp
  \fBe)\fR \fBBookmarks\fR: keep a list of your favorite directories, and even files, to get easy access to them. Example: enter 'bm' (or press Alt\-b) to open the bookmarks screen and then simply type a number or a shortcut name to access the desired bookmark.
.sp
  \fBf)\fR The \fBSelection Box\fR allows you to drop files and directories from different parts of the file system (even from different instances of CliFM) and then operate on them with just one command. Example: select a few files in one instance of the program (say 's 12; cd /media; s 2 5\-6') and then paste them somewhere else using a second instance ('v sel', 'paste sel' or Ctrl-Alt-v). Both wildcards (globbing) and regular expressions are supported. Inverse matching is also allowed for patterns.
.sp
  \fBg)\fR The \fBdirectory history\fR function (\fIback\fR and \fIforth\fR) keeps track of all visited directories, so that you can go back and forth to any of them by just entering 'b' or 'f' (or just pressing 'Alt\-j' and 'Alt\-k', or Shift\-Left and Shift\-Right, respectively). Another way of quickly navigating through visited directories is using \fIKangaroo\fR, a built-in \fBdirectory jumper\fR function. See the \fIj\fR command below.
.sp
  \fBh)\fR An extensive list of \fBkeyboard shortcuts\fR make it even easier and faster to navigate and operate on your files. For example, instead of typing 'cd ..' to go back to the parent directory, or 's *' to select all files in the current directory, you can simply press Alt\-u (or Shift\-Up) and Alt\-a respectively.
.sp
  \fBi)\fR The \fBquick search\fR function makes it really easy to quickly find the files you are looking for: just enter a slash followed by the string or regular expression you want (ex: '/myfile' or '/.*\.png'), that's all. Inverse search is also allowed by prepending an exclamation mark (!) to the search pattern.
.sp
  \fBj)\fR \fBPlugins\fR: Build your own custom commands using executable files (shell scripts or binaries). Just drop an executable file (all languages are supported) in the plugins directory, tell CliFM to use this executable file via a custom action name, and use it as any other command.
.sp
  \fBk)\fR \fBFiles preview\fR: Via the \fIfzfnav\fR plugin (see the \fBPLUGINS\fR section below), CliFM is able to preview several kinds of files, including not only text files, but also GIF's, images, office documents, PDF's, and more. This plugin requires \fIFZF\Fr to be installed. For basic images preview \fIueberzug\fR is required. A list of optional dependencies to preview different kinds of files is available in the \fBPLUGINS\fR section.
.sp
  \fBl)\fR It is blazing \fBfast\fR and incredibly \fBlightweight\fR. With a memory footprint below 5 MiB and a disk usage of 0.5 MiB, it can run on really ancient hardware. It is so simple that it doesn't require an X session nor any graphical environment at all, being able thus to perfectly run on the console (TTY) and even on a headless machine via a SSH or any other remote session. And if this is not enough, you can still try the \fBlight mode\fR to make it even faster.
.sp
  \fBm)\fR When running in \fBstealth mode\fR, it will leave not trace at all on the host system.
.sp
Because inspired by the \fBKISS\fR principle, CliFM is fundamentally aimed to be lightweight, fast, simple, and efficient. On Archlinux's notion of simplicity see: \fIhttps://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Simplicity\fR

.SH 4. POSITIONAL PARAMETERS
If the first non-option parameter is a directory, CliFM will start in this directory. Otherwise, if not a directory, it will open the file via the default associated application and exit (working thus as a stand-alone resource opener).
.sp
For example, by running 'clifm /etc/hosts', the \fIhosts\fR file will be opened and CliFM will immediately exit.
.sp
On the other side, the command 'clifm /etc' instructs CliFM to start in the directory \fI/etc\fR. If not specified, the first workspace will be used. To start in a different workspace, use the \fI\-w\fR option. For instance: 'clifm \-w4 /etc'.

.B \-\-enable\-logs
enable program logs
.TP
.B \-\-expand\-bookmarks
expand bookmark names into the corresponding bookmark paths and enable TAB completion for bookmark names as well. If the bookmark is, .e.g. mybookmark=/my/path, "mybo" will be completed as "mybookmark", which will be interpreted then as "/my/path".
.TP
.B \-\-fzftab
enable the FZF mode for TAB completion (it depends on \fIFZF\fR (\fIhttps://github.com/junegunn/fzf\fR)). This feature can also be enabled by setting the \fITabCompletionMode\fR option to 'fzf' in the configuration file
.TP
.B \-\-highlight
enable syntax highlighting. To customize highlighting colors see the \fBCOLORS\fR section below
.TP
.B \-\-icons
enable icons. Depends on the \fBicons-in-terminal\fR project.
.TP
.B \-\-icons\-use\-file\-color
instead of an specific color, icons take the color of the corresponding file name (specified either via file type or via file extension). Useful when building custom color schemes. This option implies \fB--icons\fR.
.TP
.B \-\-list\-and\-quit
list files and quit. It may be used in conjunction parameter substitution. Ex: 'clifm --list-and-quit /etc'
.TP
.B \-\-max\-dirhist

.TP
.B \-\-no\-dir\-jumper
disable the directory jumper function
.TP
.B \-\-no-classify
by default, CliFM appends a file type indicator character to file names when running with no colors (see the \fB--no-colors\fR option below) and both a directory indicator and a files counter for directories when running with colors. Classification characters are: 
 /n: directories (n = files counter)
 @: symbolic links
 |: fifo/pipes
 =: sockets
 *: executable files
 ?: unknown file type
Use this option to disable this file type classification.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-clear\-screen

do not check files capabilities when listing files
.TP
.B \-\-no\-file\-ext
do not check files extension when listing files
.TP
.B \-\-no\-files\-counter
disable the files counter for directories. This option is especially useful to speed up the listing process; counting files in directories is particularly expensive
.TP
.B \-\-no\-follow\-symlink
do not follow symbolic links when listing files
.TP
.B \-\-no\-open\-auto
same as no-cd-auto, but for files instead of directories
.TP
.B \-\-no-restore\-last\-path
by default, CliFM saves the last visited directory for each workspace to be restored in the next session. Use this option to disable this behavior.
.TP

disable the auto-suggestions system
.TP
.B \-\-no\-tips
disable startup tips
.TP
.B \-\-no\-welcome\-message
disable the welcome message
.TP
.B \-\-only\-dirs
list only directories
.TP
.B \-\-open\fR=FILE
run as a stand-alone resource opener: open \fIFILE\fR and exit. This option is deprecated: use positional parameters instead
.TP
.B \-\-opener\fR=APPLICATION
specify a resource opener to use. If \fIopener\fR is not set, \fILira\fR will be used instead
.TP
.B \-\-print\-sel
always print the list of selected files. Since this list could be quite extensive, the maximum number of selected files to print could be specified via the \fBMaxPrintSelfiles\fR option in the configuration file. Defaults to 0 (auto, i.e. never take more than half terminal height). Use -1 to remove the limit or any other positive value.
.TP
.B \-\-rl\-vi\-mode
set readline to vi editing mode (defaults to emacs editing mode)
.TP
.B \-\-share\-selbox
make the Selection Box common (that is, accessible) to different profiles. By default, each profile has a private Selection Box.
.TP
.B \-\-sort\-reverse
sort in reverse order, for example: z-a instead of a-z, which is the default order
.TP
.B \-\-trash\-as\-rm
the \fIr\fR command executes the built-in 'trash' (see the \fIt\fR command) instead of \fBrm\fR(1) to prevent accidental deletions
.TP
.B \-\-warn\-wrong\-cmd
enable the warning prompt to highlight invalid command names

.TP
Options precedence order: 1) command line; 2) configuration file; 3) default values.

.SH 6. COMMANDS
\fBNOTE:\fR ELN = Entry List Number. Example: in the line "12 openbox" (when listing files), 12 is the ELN corresponding to the file named "openbox". The slash followed by a number (/xx) after directories and symbolic links to directories (the files counter) indicates the amount of files contained by the corresponding directory, excluding self and parent directories ("." and ".." Respectively).
.sp
\fBNOTE 2:\fR In case of ELN-filename conflict the backslash can be used to prevent ELN expansion. For example, if we have at least two files and one of them in named "2", then CliFM cannot know in advance if the command refers to the ELN 2 or to the file name "2". In we want the ELN, we just write the ELN number, for example: 's 2'. But if we want the file name, we need to escape the file name using the backlash character: 's \\2'.
.sp
\fBNOTE 3:\fR CliFM supports \fBfused parameters\fR for internal commands taking an ELN or range of ELN's as parameters. Much like short options for command line programs, you can drop or omit the space between internal commands and the corresponding ELN passed as argument. In general, you can write 'CMDELN' instead of 'CMD ELN'. For example: 'o12' or 's1-5' instead of 'o 12' and 's 1-5' respectively. Bear in mind, however, that in thus omitting the space char TAB completion for ELN's won't be available. If there is a file named 'o12' (more generally, CMDELN), and if you want to refer to this file instead of a CliFM command, escape the file name to prevent the split; for example: 's \\o12'.
.sp
\fBNOTE 4:\fR CliFM implements a \fBfastback\fR function, that is to say, the conversion of "... n" or "cmd ... n" into "../.. n" or "cmd ../.. n". In other words, subsequent dots after ".." will be converted each into "/..". For example, if you are in your home directory and type "..." or "cd ...", and since "..." amounts to "../..", you will be taken to the root directory. TAB completion is available for the fastback function: "....bin" -> TAB -> "../../../bin".

.TP
.B \fRFILE/DIR
if the \fIautocd\fR and \fIauto-open\fR functions are enabled, which is the default value, open FILE or change directory to DIR. In other words, 'FILE' amounts to 'open FILE' or 'o FILE', and 'DIR' to 'cd DIR'. ELN's, of course, are allowed. Example: '12'.
.TP
.B /\fRPATTERN [\-filetype] [-x] [DIR]
this is the quick search function. Just type '/' followed by a glob or regular (or extended regular) expression, and CliFM will list all matches in the current working directory. For example, both '/*.pdf' and '/.pdf$' expressions will list all PDF files in the current working directory, the former using wildcards, and the second a regular expression.
.sp
Bear in mind that search patterns are evaluated first as glob expressions, and then, if no matches are found, as regular expressions. Expressions containing no pattern metacharacter are automatically replaced by '/*EXP*'. For example '/test' becomes '/*test*'.
.sp
To search for files in any directory other than the current one, specify the directory name as a further argument. This argument (DIR) could be an absolute path, a relative path, or an ELN. For example, enter '/^A 7' to search for all files starting with 'A' in the directory corresponding to the ELN 7.
.sp
The result of the search could be further filtered by specifying a filter type: \-d, \-r, \-l, \-s, \-f, \-b, and \-c (directory, regular file, symbolic link, socket, FIFO/pipe, block device, and character device respectively. For example, '/[.-].*d$ \-d Documents/' will list all directories containing a dot or a dash and ending with 'd' in the directory named "Documents".
.sp
The quick search function also supports invert search: prepend the exclamation mark (!) to negate a given search pattern. For example: "!.*s$ -d /etc" will match all directories in /etc NOT ending with 's', just as "!D*" will match all files in the current directory NOT starting with 'D'.
.sp
To perform a recursive search use the -x parameter, and, optionally, a search path (DIR). The search will be performed using \fIfind\fR as follows: 'find DIR -name PATTERN'. If no search path is provided, the search is executed starting in the current directory. Otherwise, the search starts in DIR.
.TP
.B ;\fR[CMD], \fB:\fR[CMD]
If no CMD, run the system shell in the current working directory. If CMD is specified, skip all CliFM expansions (see the \fBBUILT\-IN EXPANSIONS\fR section below) and run the input string (CMD) as is via the default system shell.
.TP
.B ac, ad \fRELN/FILE ... n
archive/compress and dearchive/decompress one or multiple files and/or directories. The archiver function brings two modes: \fIac\fR, to generate archives or compressed files, and \fIad\fR, to decompress or dearchive files, either just listing, extracting, recompressing, or mounting their content. In this latter case, the mountpoint used automatically is \fI$HOME/.config/clifm/PROFILE/mounts/ARCHIVE_NAME\fR.
.sp
The function accepts single and multiple file names, wildcards, ELN ranges, and the 'sel' keyword. For example: 'ac sel', 'ac 4\-25 myfile', or 'ad *.tar.gz'. Multiple archive/compression formats are supported, including Zstandard. When it comes to ISO 9660 files only single files are supported.
.sp
The archive mount function for non ISO files depends on \fBarchivemount\fR, while the remaining functions depend on \fBatool\fR and other third\-party utilities for achive formats support, for example, \fBp7zip\fR. \fBp7zip\fR is also used to manage most decompressing options for ISO 9660 files, except for mount, in which case \fBmount(8)\fR is used. Creation of ISO files is done via \fBgenisoimage(1)\fR. For more information consult \fBatool(1)\fR, \fBarchivemount(1)\fR, \fBzstd(1)\fR, and \fB7z(1)\fR. 
.TP
.B acd, autocd [on, off, status]
toggle the autocd function on/off. If set to on, 'DIR' amounts to 'cd DIR'.
.TP
.B actions \fR[edit]
with no argument, lists available custom actions (or plugins). Use the 'edit' option to add, remove or modify custom actions. The aim of this function is to allow the user to easily add custom commands and functions to CliFM. In other words, the actions function is a plugins capability.
.sp
The general procedure is quite simple: a) bind a custom action name to an executable file written in any language you want, be it a shell or Python script, a C program or whatever you like (using the \fIactions.cfm\fR file located in the configuration directory). Example: "myaction=myscript.sh". b) Now, drop the corresponding script (in our example, myscript.sh) into the plugins directory (see the \fBFILES\fR section below). 3) Once this is done, you can call the script using the custom action name defined before as if it were any other command: run 'myaction', and myscript.sh will be executed.
.sp
All arguments passed to the action command are passed to the script or program as well (which is run via the system shell).
.sp
The plugins provided with CliFM (take a look at the plugins directory) could be used as a starting point to create custom plugins.
.TP
.B alias \fR[import FILE]
with no argument, it prints the list of available aliases, if any. To write a new alias simply enter 'edit' to open the configuration file and add a line like this one: "alias name='command args...'" or "alias name='directory'".
.sp
To import aliases from a file, provided it contains aliases in the specified form, use the 'import' option. Aliases conflicting with some of the internal commands won't be imported.
.sp
However, a neat usage for the alias function is not so much to bind short keys to commands, but to files and directories visited regularly. In this way, it is possible to bind as many files or directories, no matter how deep they are in the file system, to very short strings, even single characters. For example, "alias w='/some/file/deep/in/the/filesystem'. Now, no matter where we are, we can just enter 'w', provided \fIautocd\fR and/or \fIauto-open\fR function are enabled, to access the file or directory we want. Theoretically at least, this procedure could be repeated until the system memory is exhausted.
.sp
To create multiple aliases for files at once, this is the recommended procedure: 1) Select all files you want to alias with the \fIsel\fR function: 's file1 file2 file3 ...'. 2) Export the selected files into a temporary file running 'exp sel'; 3) Edit this file to contain only valid alias lines:

 alias a1='file1'
 alias b1='file2'
 alias c1='file3'

NOTE: Make sure alias names do not conflict with other commands, either internal or external. To bypass the conflicts check, performed automatically by the 'alias import' command, you can just edit the aliases file manually.

4) Finally, import this file with the \fIalias\fR function: 'alias import tmp_file'. Now, you can access any of these files by entering just a few characters: a1, b1, and c1.
.TP
.B ao, auto-open [on, off, status]
toggle the auto-open function on/off. If set to on, 'FILE' amounts to 'open FILE'.
.TP
.B b, back \fR[h, hist] [clear] [!ELN]
unlike 'cd ..', which sends you to the parent directory of the current directory, this command (with no argument) sends you back to the previously visited directory.
.sp
CliFM keeps a record of all visited directories. You can see this list by typing 'b hist', 'b h' or 'bh', and you can access any element in this list by simply passing the corresponding ELN in this list to the \fIback\fR command. Example:
        :) > ~ $ bh
        1 /home/user
        2 /etc
        3 /proc
        :) > ~ $ b !3
        :) > /proc $ 
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fR the line printed in green indicates the current position of the \fIback\fR function in the directory history list.
.sp
Finally, you can also clear this history list by typing 'b clear'.
.sp
The best way of navigating the directory history list, however, is via the \fIdirectory jumper\fR function. See the \fIj\fR command below.
.TP
.B bl \fRELN/FILE ... n
Create symbolic links (in the current directory) for each specified file. The user will be asked to enter a specific suffix for the symlinks. If none is specified, the basename of the corresponding file is used.
.TP
.B bm, bookmarks \fR[a, add PATH] [d, del] [edit] [SHORTCUT, NAME]
with no argument, open the bookmarks menu. Here you can cd into the desired bookmark by entering either its ELN, its shortcut or its name. In this screen you can also add, remove or edit your bookmarks by simply typing 'e' to edit the bookmarks file (which is simply a list of lines with this format: [shortcut]name:path. Ex: [d]documents:/home/user/documents).
.sp
If you want to add or remove a bookmark directly from the command line, use the 'a' and 'd' arguments respectively. Example: 'bm a /media/misc' or 'bm d'. You can also open a bookmark by typing 'bm shortcut' or 'bm name' (in which latter case TAB completion is available).
.sp
A handy use for the bookmarks function, provided the expand-bookmarks option is enabled, is to create bookmarks using short names, which will be later easily accessible via TAB completion.
.TP
.B br, bulk \fRELN/FILE ... n
rename at once all files passed as arguments to the function. It accepts single and multiple file names, wildcards, ELN ranges, and the 'sel' keyword. Example: 'br myfile 4\-10 sel'.
.sp
Each file name will be copied into a temporary file, which will be opened with the default text editor (via the \fImime\fR function), letting the user modify it. Once the file has been modified and saved, the modifications are printed on the screen and the user is asked whether to proceed with the actual bulk renaming or not.
.sp
This built-in bulk rename function won't deal with deletions, replacements, file name conflicts and the like. For a smarter alternative use \fBqmv(1).
.TP
.B c, l [e, edit], m, md, r
short for the following commands respectively: 'cp -iRp', 'ln -sn', 'mv -i', 'mkdir -p', and 'rm -I' (for files) or 'rm -dIr' (for directories). To use these commands without any of these arguments, or with any other argument you need, just use the non-abbreviated command, for instance, 'cp' instead of 'c'.
.sp
NOTE: On POSIX compliant systems, like NetBSD, the \fIr\fR command amounts to \fIrm -r\fR for directories and \fIrm -f\fR for files, since the \fI-I\fR option is not available and \fI-i\fR is too instrusive.
.sp
CliFM supports \fIadvcp\fR and \fIwcp\fR to copy files (to add a progress bar to \fIcp\fR). To use them instead of \fIcp\fR set the corresponding option (cpCmd) in the configuration file. If \fIadvcp\fR is selected, the command used is 'advcp -giRp'. \fIwcp\fR takes no argument.
.sp
\fIadvmv\fR is also supported to move files (to add a progress bar to \fImv\fR). Use the 'mvCmd' option in the configuration file to choose this alternative implementation of \fImv\fR. In this case, the command used is 'advmv -gi'.
.sp
The \fIln\fR command allows the use of the 'e, edit' option to modify the destination of a symbolic link. Example: 'l e 12', or 'le 12',  to relink the symbolic link corresponding to the ELN 12.
.TP
.B cc, colors
print the color codes list currently used for files listing.
.TP
.B cd \fR[ELN/DIR]
Change the current working directory to ELN/DIR.
.sp
Directories check order:
  1. If no argument, change to the home directory (\fBHOME\fR, or, if \fBHOME\fR is not set, the sixth field of the entry corresponding to the current user in \fI/etc/passwd\fR)
  2. If argument is an absolute path (begins with a slash character), or the first component is dot (.) or dot-dot (..), convert to canonical form (via \fBrealpath\fR(3)) and, if a valid directory, change into that directory.
  3. Check \fBCDPATH\fR environment variable and append /DIR to each of the paths specified here. If the result of the concatenation is a valid directory, change into it. 
  4. Check directories in the current working directory. If a matching directory is found, change to it.
.sp
You can use either ELN's or a string to indicate the directory you want. Ex: 'cd 12' or 'cd ~/media'. If \fIautocd\fR is enabled (default), 'cd 12' and 'cd ~/media' could be written as '12' and '~/media' respectively as well.
.sp
Unlike the shell \fBcd\fR(1) command, CliFM's built\-in \fIcd\fR function not only changes the current directory, but also lists its content (provided the option \fICdListsAutomatically\fR is enabled, which is the default) according to a comprehensive list of color codes. By default, the output of \fIcd\fR is much like this shell command: cd DIR && ls \-\-color=auto \-\-group\-directories\-first.
.sp
Automatic files listing can be disabled either setting \fICdListsAutomatically\fR to "false" in the configuration file or running CliFM with the \fI-o\fR or \fI--no-list-on-the-fly\fR option.
.TP
.B cl, columns \fR[on, off]
toggle columns on/off.
.TP
.B cmd, commands
show this list of commands. A more convenient way of getting information about CliFM commands is via the interactive help plugin (depends on \fIfzf\fR), by default bound to the "ihelp" action name. 
.TP
.B cs, colorschemes \fR[edit] [NAME]
with no arguments, list available color schemes. Use the 'edit' option to open the configuration file of the current color scheme. Otherwise, just switch to the color scheme NAME. TAB completion is available.
.TP
.B d, dup \fRSOURCE [DEST]
Create a duplicate of SOURCE named DEST, where SOURCE could be either a directory or a file. If DEST is omitted, ".copy" will be appended to the basename of SOURCE and used as destination file. For example: 'd /my/file' will copy '/my/file' into the current directory as 'file.copy'. If 'file.copy' already exists, a suffix with the curent date and time will be added: 'file.copy.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS'.
.sp
If \fBrsync\fR(1) is found, it will be used as follows: 'rsync -aczvAXHS --progress'. Else, \fBcp\fR(1) will be used: 'cp -a'.
.TP
.B dc \fR[on, off, status]
toggle the files counter function on/off.
.TP
.B ds, desel \fR[*, a, all]
deselect one or more selected files. The user is prompted to either mark selected files to be deselected or to edit the selections file (entering 'e') via a text editor to manually deselect files.
.sp
You can also deselect all selected entries at once by passing \fI*\fR, \fIa\fR or \fIall\fR parameters to the function. Ex: \fIds *\fR
.TP
.B edit \fR[reset] [APPLICATION]
edit the main configuration file (F10 key is also available). If an application is specified, it will be used to open the configuration file. Use the 'reset' option to generate a fresh configuration file and create a backup copy of the old one (named clifmrc.YYYYMMDD@HH:MM:SS).
.TP
.B exp, export [FILE ...]
with no argument, export the list of files in the current working directory to a temporary file. Otherwise, export only those specified as further arguments: they could be directories, file names, ELN's or some search expression like "*.c".
.TP
.B ext \fR[on, off, status]
toggle external commands on/off.
.TP
.B f, forth \fR[h, hist] [clear] [!ELN]
it works just like the \fIback\fR function, but it goes forward in the history record. Of course, you can use 'f hist', 'f h', 'fh', and 'f !ELN'.
.TP
.B  fc, filescounter [on, off, status]
By default, CliFM prints the amount of files contained by listed directories next to directories name. However, since this is an expensive feature, It might be desirable, for example, when listing files in a remote machine, to disable this feature. Use the 'off' option to disable it. To permanently disable it, use the FilesCounter option in the configuration file.
.TP
.B ff, folders-first \fR[on, off, status]
toggle list folders first on/off.
.TP
.B fs
Print an extract from 'What is Free Software?', written by Richard Stallman.
.TP
.B ft, filter \fR[unset] [[!]REGEX]
with no argument, print the current filter. To remove the current filter use the 'unset' option. To set a new filter enter 'ft [!]REGEX'. Use the exclamation mark to reverse the behavior or a filter. For example: 'ft !^\.' will prevent hidden files from being listed, just as 'ft ^D' will list only files starting with 'D'.
.sp
The filter will be lost at program exit. To permanently set a files filter use the \fIFilter\fR option (in the configuration file). You can also use the \fBCLIFM_FILTER\fR environment variable (see below), though the value of this variable will be lost at system shutdown or reboot.
.TP
.B hf, hidden \fR[on, off, status]
toggle hidden files on/off.
.TP
.B history \fR[edit] [clear] [\-n]
with no arguments, it shows the history list. If 'clear' is passed as argument, it will delete all entries in the history file. Use 'edit' to open the history file and modify it if needed. Finally, '\-n' tells the \fIhistory\fR command to list only the last 'n' commands in the history list.
.sp
You can use the exclamation mark (!) to perform some history commands:
  !!: Execute the last command.
  !n: Execute the command number 'n' in the history list.
  !\-n: Execute the last\-n command in the history list.
  ![STRING]: Execute command starting with STRING. TAB completion is available in this case.
.sp
TAB completion is available: just type '!' and then TAB to see the complete list of history commands, or '!str' and then TAB to see the list of entries matching 'STR'. 

.TP
.B icons \fR[on, off]
toggle icons on/off
.TP
.B j, jc, jl, jp \fR[STR ...], \fBjo\fR [NUM], \fBje\fR
\fIj\fR is the fastest way of using \fBKangaroo\fR, a \fBdirectory jumper\fR function to quickly navigate through the jump database (i.e. a database of visited directories).
.sp
With no argument, \fIj\fR just lists the entries in the jump database, printing the order number of the corresponding entry, the number of visits, the days since the first visit, the rank value, and the directory name itself (an asterisk next to the rank value means that the corresponding directory is bookmarked, the current directory in some workspace or pinned). Otherwise, it searches for STR in the database and cd into the best ranked matching entry. Example: 'j D' will probably take you to \fI/home/user/Downloads\fR, provided this directory has been already visited and is the best ranked match in the database. For a more detailed description of the matching algorithm see the \fBKANGAROO FREQUENCY ALGORITHM\fR section below. 
.sp
Multiple query strings could be passed to the function. For example, 'j et mo' will first check for 'et' in the jump database and then will further filter the search using the second parameter: 'mo'. It will most probably take you (again, provided the directory has been already visited and is the best ranked match) to /etc/modprobe.d directory. Bear in mind that if STR is an actual directory, \fIjump\fR will just cd into it without performing any query.
.sp
The backslash (\\) and the slash (/) could be used to instruct \fBKangaroo\fR to search for the string query only in the first or last path segment of each entry in the database respectivelly. Let's suppose we have two entries matching \fBsrc\fR in the database: \fI/media/src/images\fR and \fI/home/user/Downloads/clifm/src\fR. If the first entry is better ranked than the second, \fIj src\fR will match this first entry. However, if what we really want is the second entry, appending a slash to the query string instructs \fBKangaroo\fR to only match entries having src in the last path segment, here \fI/home/user/Downloads/clifm/src\fR.
.sp
Since it is not always obvious or easy to know where exactly a query string will take you, CliFM (if the suggestions system is enabled) will print, at the right of the cursor, the path matched by \fBKangaroo\fR. If that is the actually intended path, just press the Right arrow key to accept the suggestion. Otherwise, it will be ignored.
.sp
\fIj\fR accepts five modifiers: 'e', 'p' 'c', 'o', and 'l', the first standing for "edit", the second for "parent", the third for "child", the fourth for "order", and the last one for 'list'. Thus, 'je' will open the jump database to be edited if needed; 'jc' will search for files querying only child directories relative to the current working directory, while 'jp' will do the same but for parent directories. 'jo' allows to specify an order number (the left most value in the jump list) instead of a string or a file name, in which case no matching process is performed. Finally, 'jl' just prints the matches for the given query string(s), but without changing the current directory. Examples:
.sp
\'jp foo\' will take you to the most visited \fBparent\fR directory containing the string "foo".
.sp
\'jc bar test\' will take you to the most visited \fBchild\fR directory containing the strings "bar" and "test".
.sp
\'jo 13\' will cd into the path corresponding to the order number 13. TAB completion is available to expand order numbers into the corresponding paths.
.sp
\'jl foo\' will print all entries in the database matching the word "foo".
.sp
To reset or modify the jump database as you wish, simply open the jump file using the 'je' command, edit whatever needs to be edited, save changes, and close the editor.
.sp
An alternative way of navigating the jump database is using the jumper plugin (located in the plugins directory and bound by default to the "++" action name), which uses \fIfzf\fR to enable fuzzy searches. Just enter ++ to perform a fuzzy search over the jump database.
.TP
.B kb, keybinds [edit] [reset] [readline]
with no argument, prints the current keyboard codes and their associated functions. To edit the keybindings file, use the 'edit' option. If you somehow messed up your keybindings, use the 'reset' option to create a fresh keybindings file with the default values. To list readline keybindings, use the 'readline' option. Bear in mind that these keybindings are not provided by CliFM, but by readline itself, and as such depend on the system settings (they can be customized however via the '~/.inputrc' file).
.TP
.B lm \fR[on, off]
Toggle the light mode on/off. This option, aimed to make files listing faster than the default mode, is especially useful for really old hardware or when working on remote machines. For more details see the \fBNOTE ON SPEED\fR section below.
.TP
.B log \fR[clear] [on, off, status]
with no arguments, it prints the contents of the log file. If 'clear' is passed as argument, all the logs will be deleted. 'on', 'off', and 'status' enable, disable, and check the status of the \fIlog\fR function for the current session.
.TP
.B mf \fRNUM
List only up to NUM files. Use -1 to list all files (default). An indicator (listed_files/total_files) will be printed below the list of files whenever some file is excluded from the current list (e.g. 20/310). Note however that though some files are excluded, all of them are loaded anyway, so that you can still perform any valid operation on them. For example, even if only 10 files are listed, you can still search for ALL symbolic links in the corresponding directory using the appropriate command: '/* -l'.
.TP
.B mm, mime \fR[info ELN/FILENAME] [edit] [import]
This is \fILira\fR, CliFM's resource opener. The 'info' option prints the MIME information about ELN/FILENAME: its MIME type, its file extension, if any, and the application associated to this MIME type or file extension.
.sp
The 'edit' option allows you to edit and customize the MIME list file. So, if a file has no default associated application, first get its MIME info or its file extension (running 'mm info FILE'), and then add a value for it to the MIME list file using the 'edit' option ('mm edit' or F6). Check the \fBRESOURCE OPENER\fR section below for information about the mimelist file syntax.
.sp
Finally, via the 'import' option CliFM will try to import MIME definitions from the system looking for \fImimeapps.list\fR files in those paths specified by the Freedesktop specification (see \fIhttps://specifications.freedesktop.org/mime-apps-spec/mime-apps-spec-latest.html\fR). If at least one MIME definition is successfuly imported, a backup of the old \fImimelist.cfm\fR file will be stored as \fImimelist.cfm.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\fR. Otherwise, no change will be made. 
.TP
.B mp, mountpoints
list available mountpoints and change the current working directory to the selected mountpoint.
.TP
.B msg, messages \fR[clear]
with no arguments, prints the list of messages in the current session. The 'clear' option tells CliFM to empty the messages list.
.TP
.B n, new \fR[FILE DIR/ ...n]
create new empty files and/or directories. If a file name ends with a slash (/), it will be taken as a directory name and created via the shell command 'mkdir -p'. Else, it will be created via the 'touch' shell command. Ex: 'n myfile mydir/', to create a file named "myfile" and a directory named "mydir". If no file name is specified, the user will be asked for one. If one or more of the specified file names already exist, ".new" will be appended to the file name.
.TP
.B net \fR[NAME] [edit] [m, mount NAME] [u, unmount NAME]
\fBThe configuration file\fR
.sp
The \fInet\fR command manages connections to remote systems via a simple samba-like configuration file (\fI$HOME/.config/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/nets.cfm\fR). Here you can specify multiple remotes and options for each of these remotes. Syntax example for this file:
.sp
 [remote_name] 
 Comment=A nice descriptive comment
 Mountpoint=/path/to/mountpoint
 MountCmd=sudo mount.cifs //111.111.111.111/share %m -o OPTIONS
 UnmountCmd=sudo umount %m
 AutoUnmount=true (Auto-mount this remote at startup)
 AutoMount=false (Auto-unmount this remote at exit)
.sp
\fBNote\fR: \fI%m\fR could be used as a placeholder for \fIMountpoint\fR. \fI%m\fR will be replaced by the value of \fIMountpoint\fR.
.sp
\fBNote 2\fR: Though originally intended to manage remote file systems, \fInet\fR can also manage \fBlocal file systems\fR. Just provide the appropriate mount and unmount commands.
.sp
\fBCommand syntax\fR
.sp
Without arguments, \fInet\fR lists the configuration for each remote available in the configuration file.
.sp
Use the \fIedit\fR option to edit the remotes configuration file. If no further argument is specified, the file will be opened with the current resource opener. However, you can pass an application as second parameter to open to configuration file. Example: 'net edit nano'.
.sp
If not already mounted, the \fIm\fR, \fImount\fR option mounts the specified remote using the mount command and the mounpoint specified in the confifuration file and automatically cd into the corresponding mountpoint. Example: \fInet m smb_work\fR. \fIm\fR, \fImount\fR could be omitted, so that \fInet smb_work\fR amounts to \fInet m smb_work\fR. TAB completion is available for this function.
.sp
The \fIu\fR, \fIunmount\fR option unmounts the specified remote using the unmount command specified in the configuration file. For example: \fInet u smb_work\fR. TAB completion is also available for this function.
.TP
.B o, open \fRELN/FILE [APPLICATION]
open FILE, which can be either a directory, in which case it works just like the \fIcd\fR command (see above), a regular file, or a symbolic link to either of the two. For example: 'o 12', 'o filename', 'o /path/to/filename'.
.sp
By default, the \fIopen\fR function will open files with the default application associated to them via \FbLira\fR, the built\-in resource opener (see the \fImime\fR command above). However, if you want to open a file with a different application, just add the application name as second argument, e.g. 'o 12 leafpad' or 'o12 leafpad'.
.sp
If you want to run the program in the background, simply add the ampersand character, as usual: 'o 12 &', 'o 12&', 'o12&' or (if auto-open is enabled) just '12&'.
.sp
If the file to be opened is an archive/compressed file, the archive function (see the \fIad\fR command above) will be executed instead.
.TP
.B opener \fR[default] [APPLICATION]
with no argument, prints the currently used resource opener (by default, \fILira\fR, CliFM's built\-in opener). Otherwise, set APPLICATION as opener or, if 'default' is passed instead, use \fILira\fR. 
.TP
.B p, pr, prop \fRELN/FILE ... n
print file properties for ELN/FILE. The output of this function is much like the combined output of 'ls -l' and 'stat'. By default, directories size is not shown. Use \fIpp\fR instead of just \fIp\fR to print directories size as well (it could take longer depending on the directory's content).
.TP
.B path, cwd
print the current working directory.
.TP
.B pf, prof, profile \fR[ls, list] [set, add, del PROFILE]
with no arguments, prints the name of the currently used profile. Use the 'ls' or 'list' option to list available profiles. To switch, add or delete a profile, use the 'set', 'add', and 'del' options respectively followed by the corresponding profile name. Bear in mind that, when switching profiles, command line arguments will be ignored.
.TP
.B pg, pager \fR[on, off, status]
toggle \fBMas\fR, the built-in pager, on/off. Useful to list directories with hundreds or thousands of files, the pager will start working, if set to on, whenever the screen is not enough to list all files.
.sp
Once in the pager, press the Down arrow key, Space or Enter to move downwards one line, or PageDown to move downwards an entire page. To go upwards, use the shortcuts provided by your terminal emulator, for example, Alt\-PageUp or Alt\-Up. Press 'c', 'p', or 'q' keys to stop the pager, and 'h' or '?' for help.
.TP
.B pin \fR[FILE/DIR]
pin a file or a directory to be accessed later via the comma (,) keyword. For example, run 'pin mydir' and then access "mydir" as follows: 'cd ,' where the comma is automatically expanded to the pinned file, in this case "mydir". The comma keyword could be used with any command, either internal or external, e.g, 'ls ,'.
.sp
With no arguments, the \fIpin\fR command prints the current pinned file, if any. If an argument is given, it will be taken as a file name to be pinned. Running this command again, frees the previous pinned file and sets a new one. In other words, only one pin is supported at a time. 
.sp
An easy alternative to create as many pins or shortcuts as you want, and how you want, is to use the \fIalias\fR function. Bookmarks could also be used to achieve a very similar result.
.sp
At program exit, the pinned file is written to a file in the configuration directory (as .pin) to be loaded in the next session.
.TP
.B q, quit, exit, Q
Gracefully quit CliFM. Use 'Q' to gracefully quit and enable the CD on quit functionality (write last visited directory to \fI$XDG_CONFIG/clifm/.last\fR to be later read by a shell function. See the \fBSHELL FUNCTIONS\fR section below).
.TP
.B rf, refresh
refresh the screen, that is, reprint files in the current directory and update the prompt. If the current directory is not accessible for any reason, \fIrf\fR will go up until it finds an accessible one and then will change to that directory.
.TP
.B rl, reload
Reload all settings, except those passed as command line arguments, from the configuration file.
.TP
.B s, sel \fRELN/FILE ... n [[!]PATTERN] [-filetype] [:PATH]
send one or multiple elements (either files or directories) to the Selection Box. \fIsel\fR accepts individual elements, range of elements, say 1\-6, file names and paths, just as wildcards (globbing) and regular expressions. Example: 's 1 4\-10 ^r file* file name /path/to/filename'. To deselect selected files, use the \fIds\fR command (see above), or the M-d keyboard shortcut.
.sp
Just as in the \fIsearch\fR function, it is also possible to further filter the list of matches indicating the desired file type. For instance, 's ^ -d' will select all directories in the current working directory. For available file type filters see the \fIsearch\fR function above.
.sp
By default, the selection function operates on the current working directory. To select files in any other directory use the ":PATH" expression. For example, to select all regular files with a .conf extension in the /etc directory, the command would be: 's .*\\.conf$ -r :/etc', or using wildcards: 's *.conf -r :/etc'.
.sp
Just as in the case of the \fIsearch\fR function, inverse matching is supported for patterns, either wildcards or regular expressions. To invert or reverse the meaning and action of a pattern, just prepend an exclamation mark (!). E.g., to select all non-hidden regular files in the Documents directory, issue this command: 's !^\. -r :Documents', or, to select all directories in /etc, except those ending with ".d": 's !*.d -d :/etc'.
.sp
Glob and regular expressions could be used together. For example: 's ^[r|R].*d$ /etc/*.conf' will select all files starting with either 'r' or 'R' and ending with 'd' in the current working directory, plus all .conf files in the /etc directory. However, this use is discouraged if both patterns refer to the same directory, since the second one will probably override the result of the first one.
.sp
It is important to note that glob expressions are evaluated before regular expressions, in such a way that any pattern that could be understood by both kinds of pattern matching mechanisms will be evaluated first according to the former, that is, as a glob expression. For example, '.*', as regular expression, should match all files. However, since glob expressions are evaluated first, it will only match hidden files. To select all files using a glob expression, try '.* *', or, with a regular expression: '^' or '(.*?)'. The keyboard shortcut M-a is also available to perform the same operation.
.sp
The Selection Box is accessible to different instances of the program, provided they use the same profile (see the \fIprofile\fR command below). By default, indeed, each profile keeps a private Selection Box, being thus not accessible to other profiles. You can nonetheless modify this behavior via the ShareSelbox option in the configuration file. If the ShareSelbox option is enabled (see the configuration file), selected files are stored in \fI/tmp/clifm/username/.selbox\fR. Otherwise, \fI/tmp/clifm/username/.selbox_profilename\fR is used (this is the default). 
.TP
.B sb, selbox
show the elements currently contained in the Selection Box.
.TP
.B splash
show the splash screen.
.TP
.B st, sort \fR[METHOD] [rev]
with no argument, print the current sorting method. Else, set sorting method to METHOD, where METHOD could be one of: 0 = none, 1 = name, 2 = size, 3 = atime, 4 = btime (ctime, if btime is not available), 5 = ctime, 6 = mtime, 7 = version (name, if ctime is not available), 8 = extension, and 9 = inode, 10 = owner, and 11 = group. Both numbers and names are allowed. Bear in mind that methods 10 and 11 sort by owner and group ID number, not by owner and group names.
.sp
By default, files are sorted from less to more (ex: from 'a' to 'z' if using the "name" method). Use the 'rev' option to invert this order. Ex: 'st rev' or 'st 3 rev'. Switch back to the previous ordering running 'st rev' again.
.TP
.B t, tr, trash  \fR[ELN/FILE ... n] [ls, list] [clear] [del, rm]
with no argument (or by passing the 'ls' option), it prints a list of currently trashed files. The 'clear' option removes all files from the trash can, while the 'del' option lists trashed files allowing you to remove one or more of them.
.sp
The trash directory is \fI$XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash\fR, usually \fI~/.local/share/Trash\fR. Since this trash system follows the Freedesktop specification, it is able to handle files trashed by different Trash implementations.
.TP
.B te \fRFILE(s)
toggle executable bit (on user, group, and others) on FILE(s). It is equivalent to the -x and +x options for the shell \fBchmod\fR(1) command.
.TP
.B tips
print the list of CliFM tips
.TP
.B u, undel, untrash \fR[*, a, all]
print a list of currently trashed files allowing you to choose one or more of these files to be undeleted, that is to say, restored to their original location. You can also undelete all trashed files at once using the '*', 'a' or 'all' option.
.TP
.B uc, unicode \fR[on, off, status]
toggle unicode on/off.
.TP
.B unpin
this command takes no argument. It just frees the current pin and, if it exists, deletes the .pin file generated by the \fIpin\fR command.
.TP
.B v, vv, paste \fRsel [DESTINY]
the 'paste sel' or 'v sel' command copies the currently selected files, if any, into the current working directory. To copy these files into another directory, tell 'paste' where to copy these files. Ex: 'paste sel /path/to/directory'. The \fIcopy\fR command (cp, c) could be used in the same way: 'c sel' indeed copies selected files into the current directory. Use the 'vv' command instead of just 'v' to copy selected files and rename them at once.
.TP
.B ver, version
show CliFM version details.
.TP
.B ws \fR[NUM, +, -]
CliFM offers up to eight workspaces, each with its own independent path.
.sp
With no argument, the \fIws\fR command prints the list of workspaces and its corresponding paths, highlighting the current workspace. Use NUM to switch to workspace NUM, the plus sign (+) to switch to the next workspace, and the minus sign (-) to switch to the previous workspace. Four keyboard shortcuts are available to easily switch to any of the first four workspaces: Alt-[1-4].
.sp
Every time an empty workspace is created, it starts in the path of the workspace from which it was invoked (in other words, in the current working directory).
.TP
.B x, X \fR[DIR]
open DIR, or the current working directory if DIR is not specified, in a new instance of CliFM (as root if \fIX\fR, as unprivileged user if \fIx\fR) using the value of TerminalCmd (from the configuration file) as terminal emulator. If this value is not set, 'xterm' will be used as fallback terminal emulator. This function is only available for graphical environments.

.SH 7. FILE FILTERS
CliFM offers three kinds of file filters:
.sp
 a) A dot filter to permanently exclude hidden files from the files list. See the \fB-A\fR and \fB-a\fR options above.
.sp
 b) Files filter via regular expressions (using the \fIFilter\fR option in the configuration file or the CLIFM_FILTER environment variable) to permanently exclude certain groups of file names, for example, backup files or files ending with a tilde (~).
.sp
 c) Local filter via the \fIQuick search\fR function (supporting both regular expressions, wildcards, and invert matching) to temporarily filter the current list of files.

NOTE: C stands for Control, S for Shift, and M for the Meta key (the Alt key in most keyboards).
.TP
NOTE 2: Some of these keybindings might not work on your console/terminal emulator, depending on your system. Some useful tips on this regard:
.TP
Haiku terminal: Most of these keybindings won't work on the Haiku terminal, since Alt plays here the role Ctrl usually plays in most other systems (see the Haiku documentation). To fix this just set your custom keybindings.
.TP
Kernel built-in console: Key sequences involving the Shift key (S-up, S-left, and S-right in our case) will just not work. Use the alternative key sequences instead: M-u, M-j, and M-k respectively
.TP
NetBSD (wsvt25) and OpenBSD (vt220) kernel consoles: Key sequences involving the Alt key won't work out of the box. Here's how to make it work:

 On OpenBSD:
 1) Copy /etc/examples/wsconsctl.conf to /etc (if it does not already exist)
 2) Add the metaesc flag to your current keyboard enconding. For example keyboard.encoding=us.metaesc
 You might need to reboot the machine for changes to take effect.

 On NetBSD:
 Add the metaesc flag to your current encoding in /etc/wscons.conf. Example: encoding us.metaesc
 You might need to reboot the machine for changes to take effect.
.TP
Konsole: If Shift+left and Shift+right are not already bound to any function, you need to bind them manually. Go to Settings -> Edit current profile -> Keyboard -> Default (Xfree4), and add these values:
 Left+Shift	\\E[1;2D
 Right+Shift	\\E[1;2C
.sp
If they are already bound, by contrast, you only need to unbound them. Go to "Settings -> Configure keyboard shortcuts", click on the corresponding keybinding, and set it to "Custom (none)").
.TP
Terminology/Yakuake: Shift+left and Shift+right are already bound to other functions, so that you only need to unbind them or rebind the corresponding functions to different key sequences.
.TP
Of course, the above two procedures should be similar in case of keybinding issues in other terminal emulators.
.TP
In case some of these keybindings are already used by your Window Manager, you only need to unbind the key or rebind the corresponding function to another key. Since each Window Manager uses its own mechanisms to set/unset keybindings, you should consult the appropriate manual.
.TP
\fBCustomizing keybindings\fR
.TP
The above are the default keyboard shortcuts. However, they can be freely modified using the 'kb edit' command (or pressing F9) or just editing the keybindings file (see the \fBFILES\fR section below) to your liking.
.TP
Since CliFM does not depend on the curses library, keybindings are set up via ANSI escape codes, for example, "\e[17~" for the F6 key. The two main difficulties with ANSI escape codes are: 1) They are not intuitive at all, and 2) They vary depending on the terminal emulator used. This is why we provide a plugin (kbgen) to more easily configure your keybindings.
.TP
The plugin can be found in the plugins directory as a C source file. The first step, therefore, is to compile this source file to produce a binary file. Compile as follows:
.TP
 gcc -o kbgen kbgen.c
.TP
\fBNote\fR: Depending on your system, you might need to link against the curses library adding either \fB-lcurses\fR or \fB-lncurses\fR to the above line. 
.TP
Now, just run the plugin entering './kbgen'. Use either octal, hexadecimal codes or symbols. Example: For F12 'kbgen' will print the following lines:
.sp
 Hex  | Oct  | Symbol
 ---- | ---- | ------
 \\x1b | \\033 | ESC (\\e)
 \\x5b | \\133 | [
 \\x32 | \\062 | 2
 \\x34 | \\064 | 4
 \\x7e | \\176 | ~
.TP
In this case, supposing you want to use F12 to open the configuration file, the keybinding would be any of the following:
.sp
 open-config:\\x1b\\x5b\\x32\\x34\\x7e (Hex)
 open-config:\\033\\133\\062\\064\\176 (Oct)
 open-config:\\e[24~ (Symbol) 
.TP
GNU emacs escape sequences are also allowed (ex: "\\M-a", Alt-a in most keyboards, or "\\C-r" for Ctrl-r). Some codes, especially those involving keys like Ctrl or the arrow keys, vary depending on the terminal emulator and the system settings. These keybindings should be set up thus on a per terminal basis. You can also consult the terminfo database via the \fIinfocmp\fR command. See \fBterminfo\fR(5) and \fBinfocmp\fR(1).
.TP
.B Readline keybindings
.TP
System readline keybindings for command line editing, such as \fICtrl-a\fR, to move the cursor to the beginning of the line, or \fICtrl-e\fR, to move it to the end, should work out of the box. Of course, you can modify readline keybindings using the \fI$HOME/.inputrc\fR file, either globally or for some specific terminal or application. In this latter case, it is possible to set keybindings specifically for CliFM using the \fIapplication\fR construct, that is, telling readline that the following keybindings apply only to CliFM. For example, to bind the function "kill-whole-line" to \fICtrl-b\fR, add the following lines to your \fI.inputrc\fR file:
.sp
 $if clifm
 "\\C\-b": kill\-whole\-line
 $endif
.TP
.B Keybindings for plugins
.TP
CliFM provides four customizable keybindings for custom plugins. The procedure for setting a keybinding for a plugin is the following:
 1) Copy your plugin to the plugins directory (or use any of the plugins already in there)
 2) Link pluginx (where 'x' is the plugin number [1-4]) to your plugin using the 'actions edit' command. Ex: "plugin1=myplugin.sh"
 3) Set a keybinding for pluginx using the 'kb edit' command. Ex: "plugin1:\\M\-7"

.SH 9. COLOR CODES
.TP
All color codes are specified in the corresponding color scheme file (by default \fI~/.config/clifm/colors/default.cfm\fR). You can edit this file pressing \fBF8\fR or entering \fIcs edit\fR.
.TP
Colors are specified using the same format used by \fBdircolors(1)\fR and the \fBLS_COLORS\fR environment variable, namely, a colon separated list of codes with this general format: filetype=color. This is the list of \fBfile type codes\fR (you'll find them in the \fIFiletypeColors\fR section of the current color scheme file):
.sp
 di = directory
 ed = empty directory
 nd = directory with no read permission
 ne = empty directory with no read permission
 fi = regular file
 ef = empty regular file
 nf = file with no access permission
 ln = symlink
 mh = multi-hardlink file
 or = orphaned or broken symlink
 bd = block device
 cd = character device
 pi = FIFO, pipe
 so = socket
 su = SUID file
 sg = SGID file
 tw = sticky and other writable directory
 st = sticky and not other writable directory
 ow = other writable directory
 ex = executable file
 ee = empty executable file
 ca = file with capabilities
 no = unknown file type
 uf = unaccessible files (\fBfstatat\fR(3) error)

.TP
The following codes are used for different interface elements (in the \fIInterfaceColors\fR section of the current color scheme file):
.sp
 \fBSuggestions\fR
 sc = aliases and shell command names
 sf = ELN's, bookmarks, file and directory names
 sh = commands history entries
 sx = suggestions for CliFM's internal commands and parameters
 wp = warning prompt color (See below the \fBAUTO-SUGGESTIONS\fR section)

 \fBSyntax highlighting\fR
 hb = brackets '()[]{}'
 hc = comments (lines starting with '#')
 hd = slashes
 he = expansion chars '~*'
 hn = numbers
 hp = option parameters (starting with '-')
 hq = quoted strings (both single and double quotes)
 hr = process redirection (>)
 hs = process separators (; & |)
 hv = variable names (starting with '$')

 \fBDefault Prompt\fR
 li = selected files
 ti = trash indicator
 em = error message indicator
 wm = warning message indicator
 nm = notice message indicator
 si = stealth mode indicator

 \fBMiscellaneous interface elements\fR
 bm = bookmarked directory in the bookmarks screen
 el = ELN color
 mi = misc indicators (disk usage, sort method, bulk rename)
 tx = command line text
 df = default color
 dc = files counter
 wc = welcome message
 dh = directory history index
 dl = dividing line
 ts = matching suffix for possible TAB completed entries
.TP
Color codes are just traditional ANSI color codes less the escape character and the final 'm'. Thus, for instance, if you want non\-empty directories to be bold blue, add this to the \fIFiletypeColors\fR line in the corresponding color scheme file: \fBdi=01;34\fR. If you want ELN's to be red, add this code to the \fIInterfaceColors\fR line: \fBel=00;31\fR
.TP
Color codes can be used for file extensions as well using this format: *.ext=color. For example, to print C source files in bold green, add this to the \fIExtColors\fR line in the corresponding color scheme file: \fB*.c=01;32\fR
.TP
Though by default CliFM uses only 8 colors, you can use 256 and RGB colors as well. Example: \fBfi=04;38;2;245;76;00;48;2;00;00;255\fR will print regular files underlined and using a bold orange RGB color on a blue background. In this case, just make sure to use a terminal emulator supporting RGB colors. To test your terminal color capabilities use the \fIcolors.sh\fR script (in the plugins directory).
.TP
File types and file extension colors, just as interface colors, are specified by the current color scheme and can be modified as you wish (see the \fIcs\fR command above).
.TP
To see a colored list of the currently used file color codes run \fIcc\fR or \fIcolors\fR in CliFM.

.SH 10. THE PROMPT
.TP
CliFM's prompt is built from the \fIPrompt\fR line in the configuration file following almost the same escape codes and rules used by the Bash prompt, except that it does not accept shell functions (like conditionals and loops). Command substitution (in the form $(cmd)), string literals, and escape codes can be used to build the prompt line and its colors. This is a list of supported escape codes:
.TP
\\e: Escape character
.TP
\\h: The hostname, up to the first ‘.’
.TP
\\u: The username
.TP
\\H: The full hostname
.TP
\\n: A newline character
.TP
\\r: A carriage return
.TP
\\a: A bell character
.TP
\\d: The date, in abbreviated form (ex: “Tue May 26”)
.TP
\\s: The name of the shell (everything after the last slash) currently used by CliFM
.TP
\\S: Current workspace number
.TP
\\l: Print an 'L' if in light mode
.TP
\\P: The current profile name
.TP
\\t: The time, in 24\-hour HH:MM:SS format
.TP
\\T: The time, in 12\-hour HH:MM:SS format
.TP
\\@: The time, in 12\-hour am/pm format
.TP
\\A: The time, in 24\-hour HH:MM format
.TP
\\w: The full current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
.TP
\\W: The basename of $PWD, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
.TP
\\p: A mix of the two above, it abbreviates the current working directory only if longer than PathMax (a value defined in the configuration file).
.TP
\\z: Exit code of the last executed command. Green in case of success and bold red in case of error
.TP
\\$ '#', if the effective user ID is 0, and '$' otherwise
.TP
\\nnn: The character whose ASCII code is the octal value nnn
.TP
\\\\: A backslash
.TP
\\[: Begin a sequence of non\-printing characters. This is mostly used to add color to the prompt line
.TP
\\]: End a sequence of non\-printing characters

.TP
By default, for example, CliFM's prompt line is this: 

\fB"\\[\\e[0m\\][\\[\\e[0;36m\\]\\S\\[\\e[0m\\]]\\l \\A \\u:\\H \\[\\e[00;36m\\]\\w\\n\\[\\e[0m\\]<\\z\\[\\e[0m\\]>\\[\\e[0;34m\\] \\$\\[\\e[0m\\] "\fR

.TP
which once decoded should look something like this:

 \fB[1] 13:45 user:hostname /my/path
 <0> $\fR
.TP
with the workspace number and the path printed in cyan, the last exit status in green, and the dollar sign in blue.
.TP
A more "classic" prompt could be construed as follows:

 \fB"\\u@\\U \\w> "\fR
.TP
or, using now command substitution:

 \fB"$(whoami)@$(hostname) $(pwd)> "\fR
.TP

\fBAdvanced prompt customization\fR
.TP
Besides commands substitution, which allows you to include in the prompt any information you like via shell scripts or simple shell commands, the use of Unicode characters allows you to build colorful and modern prompts.
.TP
Inserting Unicode characters in the prompt can be made in two ways:
.TP
\fBa)\fR Pasting the character itself using a text editor
.TP
\fBb)\fR Entering the hexadecimal code corresponding to the character. Use \fBhexdump\fR(1) as follows to get the appropriate hex code:

 echo -ne "[paste the char here]" | hexdump -C
.TP
The first line of the output will be something along these lines:

 00000000  ef ae 8a               |...|
.TP
In this case, the hex code is: "ef ae 8a". So, to insert this Unicode character in the prompt, add this code as follows:

 Prompt="... \\xef\\xae\\x8a ..."
.TP
\fBNote\fR: Make sure you have installed a font able to display Unicode characters.
.TP
A few advanced prompt examples can be found in the prompts file in our Github site. Take a look at <https://github.com/leo-arch/clifm/wiki/Customization#the-prompt>
.TP
\fBPrompt notifications\fR
.TP
A bold red 'R' at the left of the prompt reminds the user that the program is running as root. A bold green asterisk indicates that there are elements in the Selection Box. In the same way, a yellow 'T' means that there are currently files in the trash can, just as a bold blue 'S' means that the program is running in stealth mode. Finally, CliFM makes use of three kind of messages: errors (a red 'E' at the left of the prompt), warnings (a yellow 'W'), and simple notices (a green 'N').
.TP
If \fIPromptStyle\fR is set to "custom" in the configuration file, the above notifications won't be printed by the prompt, and the information necessary to construct them will be exported to the envitonment to let your custom prompt handle them itself. See the \fBENVIRONMENT\fR section below.

.TP
\fBThe dividing line\fR
.TP
Though not strictly part of the prompt, the line dividing the current list of files and the prompt could be customized, via the \fIDividingLineChar\fR option in the configuration file, to fit your prompt design and/or color scheme.
.TP
\fIDividingLineChar\fR accepts one or more ASCII or Unicode characters (in both cases you only need to type/paste here the chosen character(s)). If only one character is specified, it will be repeatedly printed to fulfill the current line up to the edge of the screen or terminal window. Otherwise, if multiple characters are specified, they will be printed as is, disregarding the string's length.
.TP
By default, the value of \fRDividingLineChar\fR is a single dash (-), and because it is a single character, the line is fulfilled with dashes. If you don't want to cover the whole line, just specify three or more characters, in which case only these characters will be used as dividing line. For example: '------->'.
.TP
The color of this line is set via the \fIdl\fR color code in the color scheme file. Consult the \fBCOLORS\fR section above for more information.

.SH 11. BUILT\-IN EXPANSIONS
.TP
Besides the default \fITAB completion\fR for command \fBnames and paths\fR, you can also expand \fBELN's\fR using the TAB key. Example: type 'o 12', press TAB, and it becomes 'o filename ', or, if 12 refers to a directory, 'o dir/'. CliFM uses a Bash\-style quoting system, so that this file name: "this is a test@version{1}" is expanded as follows: this\\ is\\ a\\ test\\@version\\{1\\}
.TP
CliFM will automatically expand the \fB'sel' keyword\fR: 'sel' indeed amounts to 'file1 file2 file3 ...' In this way, you can use the 'sel' keyword with any command. If you want to set the executable bit on several files, for instance, simply select the files you want and then run this command: 'chmod +x sel'. Or, if you want to copy or move several files into some directory: 'cp sel 12', or 'mv sel 12' (provided the ELN 12 corresponds to a directory), respectively. If the destiny directory is omitted, selected files are copied into the current working directory, that is to say, 'mv sel' amounts to 'mv sel .'. To trash or remove selected files, simply run 'tr sel' or 'rm sel' respectively. The same goes for wildcards and braces: 'chmod +x *', for example, will set the executable bit on all files (excluding hidden files) in the current working directory, while 'chmod +x file{1,2,3}' will do it for file1, file2, and file3 respectively.
.TP
ELN's and \fBELN ranges\fR will be also automatically expanded, provided the corresponding ELN's actually exist, that is to say, provided some file name is listed on the screen under those numbers. For example: 'diff 1 118' will only expand '1', but not '118', if there is no ELN 118. In the same way, the range 1\-118 will only be expanded provided there are 118 or more elements listed on the screen. If this feature somehow conflicts with the command you want to run, say, 'chmod 644 ...', because the current amount of files is equal or larger than 644 (in which case CliFM will expand that number), then you can simply run the command as external: ';chmod 644...'
.TP
TAB completion for \fBbookmarks, color schemes, profiles, sort method, and directory history\fR (via the \fIjump\fR command) is also available. To make use of the bookmarks completion, make sure to specify some name for your bookmarks, since these names are used by the completion function. 
.TP
Of course, combinations of all these features is also possible. Example: 'cp sel file* 2 23\-31 .' will copy all selected files, plus all files whose name starts with "file", plus those files corresponding to the ELN's 2, and 23 to 31, into the current working directory.
.TP
In addition to completions and expansions, an \fIauto-suggestions system\fR is also available. See the \fBAUTO-SUGGESTIONS\fR section below.

.SH 12. RESOURCE OPENER
\fBLira\fR is CliFM's built-in resource opener, and is controlled via the \fImime\fR command (see above). File associations are stored in the MIME list file (see the \fBFILES\fR section below).
.TP
When running for the first time, or whenever the MIME list file cannot be found, CliFM will copy the MIME definitions file from the DATADIR directory (usually \fI/usr/share/clifm/mimelist.cfm\fR) to the local configuration directory. This file follows these simple syntax rules:
.TP
Each line in the MIME list file consists of:
.TP
a) 'X' or '!X' to specify GUI and non-GUI environments.
b) A left value, containing either a file extension or a MIME type to be matched. Regular expressions are supported;
.TP
c) A right value, a list of semicolon separated commands (and optionally the commands parameters) to be associated to the corresponding left value. Use the %f placeholder to specify the position of the file name to be executed in the command, for example: 'mpv %f --terminal=no'. If the placeholder is not specified, the file name will be added to the end of the command string.
.TP
Note that the syntax departs here from the Freedesktop specification in that we do not rely on desktop files (mostly used by desktop environments), but rather on commands and parameters. In general thus, the syntax is this:

 X:MIME=CMD [ARGS] [%f];CMD [ARGS] [%f]; ...
.TP
or, for file extensions:

 X:E:EXT=CMD [ARGS] [%f];CMD [ARGS] [%f]; ...
.TP
Use '!X' to specify applications when running on non-graphical environments:
 !X:E:EXT=CMD [ARGS] [%f];CMD [ARGS] [%f]; ...

.TP
Examples:
.TP
Match single extension:
 E:^txt$:leafpad;mousepad;kate;gedit
 !E:^txt$:nano;vim;vi;emacs

.TP
Note the 'E' character: it indicates that this rule is intended to match a file extension and not a MIME type, just as 'X' means that this rule is aimed to graphical environments, and '!X' that the rule is aimed to non-graphical environments.
.TP
Match multiple extensions:
 X:E:^(sh|c|py|pl)$:geany;leafpad;nano
.TP
Match single mimetype:
 X:^audio/mp3$=mpv %f --terminal=no;ffplay -nodisp -autoexit;mpv;mplayer
.TP
Match mutiple mimetypes:

.TP
In case of MIME types, you can also write the entire expression without relying on any regular expression. For example:
 !X:text/plain=nano
.TP
\fBLira\fR will check the file line by line, and if a matching line is found, and if at least one of the specified applications exists, this application will be used to open the corresponding associated file. Else, the next line will be checked. In other words, the precedence order is top to bottom (for lines) and left to right (for applications).

.SH 13. AUTO-SUGGESTIONS
\fIGemini\fR is a built-in suggestions system (similar to that provided by the Fish shell). As you type, \fIGemini\fR will suggest possible completions right after the current cursor position.

The following checks are availabe (the order can be customized, see below):
.sp
a. ELN's
.sp
b. CliFM commands and parameters (including the \fIsel\fR keyword)
.sp
c. Entries in the command history list (already used commands)
.sp
d. File names in the current working directory
.sp
e. Entries in the jump database
.sp
f. Aliases names
.sp
g. Bookmarks names
.sp
h. Program names in \fBPATH\fR 
.sp
i. Shell builtins

\fBNOTE:\fR The shell name is taken from \fI/bin/sh\fR. The following shell are supported: bash, dash, fish, ksh, tcsh, and zsh. Command names are checked in the following order: CliFM internal commands, commands in \fBPATH\fR, and shell builtins.

To accept the entire suggestion, just press \fBRight\fR or \fBCtrl-f\fR: the cursor will move to the end of the suggested command and the suggestion color will change to that of the typed text; next, you can press \fBEnter\fR to execute the command as usual. Otherwise, if the suggestion is not accepted, it will be simply ignored and you can continue editing the current command line however you want.

To aceppt the first suggested word only (up to first slash or space), press rather \fBAlt-Right\fR or \fBAlt-f\fR. Not available for ELN's, aliases and bookmarks names.

Bear in mind that suggestions for ELN's, aliases and bookmarks names, and the jump function (invoked by the \fIj\fR command) do not work as the remaining suggestions: they do not suggest possible completions for the current input, but rather the value pointed to by it. For example, if you type "12" and the current list of files includes a file name whose ELN is '12', the file name corresponding to this ELN will be printed next to "12" as follows: \fB12_ > filename\fR (where the underscore is the current cursor position). Press 'Right' or 'Ctrl-f' to accept the suggestion, in which case the text typed so far will be replaced by the suggestion.

The order of the suggestion checks could be customized via the \fISuggestionStrategy\fR option in the configuration file. Each check is assigned a lowercase letter:

 a = Aliases names
 b = Bookmark names
 c = Possible completions
 e = ELN's
 f = Files in the current directory
 h = Entries in the commands history
 j = Entries in the jump database

The value taken by \fISuggestionStrategy\fR is a string of seven(7) characters containing the above letters. The letters order in this string specifies the order in which the suggestion checks will be performed. For example, to perform all checks in the same order above, the value of the string should be \fBabcefhj\fR (without quotes). Or, if you prefer to run the history check first: \fBhabcefj\fR. Finally, you can ignore one or more checks using a dash (-). So, to ignore the bookmarks and aliases checks, set \fISuggestionStrategy\fR to \fBh--cefj\fR. The default value for this option is \fBehfjbac\fR.

\fBNote\fR: The check for program names in \fBPATH\fR is always executed at last, except when the \fIExternalCommands\fR option is disabled, in which case suggestions for them are simply not displayed.

Suggestions will be printed using one of the following color codes (see the \fBCOLOR CODES\fR section above):

\fIsf\fR: Used for file and directory names. This includes suggestions for ELN's, bookmarks names, files in the current directory, and possible completions. Default value: 02;04;36 (dimmed underlined cyan)

\fIsh\fR: Used for entries in the commands history. Default value: 02;35 (dimmed magenta)

\fIsc\fR: Used for aliases and program names in \fBPATH\fR. Default value: 02;31 (dimmed red)

\fIsx\fR: Used for CliFM internal commands and parameters. Default value: 02;32 (dimmed green)

\fImi\fR: Greater-than sign (>) used when suggesting ELN's, bookmarks, and aliases names. Default value: 02;31 (dimmed red)

You can set \fBSuggestFiletypeColor\fR to "true" in the configuration file to use the color of the file type of the current file name (as set in the color scheme file) instead of the value of
\fIsf\fR. For example, if a suggestion is printed for a file that is a symbolic link, \fIln\fR or \fIor\fR (if a broken link) will be used instead of \fIsf\fR.

\fBThe warning prompt\fR

CliFM includes a \fBwarning prompt\fR to highlight invalid, wrong, or non-existent command names. Enable it via the \fI--warn-wrong-cmd\fR command line option or setting \fIWarningPrompt\fR to "true" in the configuration file. This features depends on suggestions (make sure suggestions are enabled before enabling the warning prompt).

The wrong command name check is omitted if the input string:

    Is quoted (ex: "string" or 'string')
    Is bracketed (ex: (string), [string], or {string})
    It starts with a stream redirection character (ex: <string or >string)
    Is a comment (ex: #string)
    It starts with one or more spaces
    Is an assignment (ex: foo=var)
    It is escaped (ex: \string)

By default, the string used by the warning prompt is \fB"(!) > "\fR, though it can be customized using the \fIWarningPromptStr\fR in the condifuration file.

The default color of the warning prompt is dimmed red (\fI02;32\fR), but it can be customized setting \fIwp\fR in the current color scheme file (in the \fIInterfaceColors\fR section) to the color you want. Consult the \fBCOLOR CODES\fR section above.

.SH 14. SHELL FUNCTIONS
CliFM includes a few shell functions to perform specific actions (cd-on-quit, file-picker, and subshell-notice). Take a look at the corresponding files, in \fI/usr/share/clifm/functions\fR, and follow the instructions. Needles to say, you can write your own functions.

.SH 15. PLUGINS
Plugins are just scripts or programs (written in any language) able to add, extend or improve CliFM functionalities. Though several plugins are provided at installation time (in the \fIplugins\fR directory), you can write your owns as you like, with any language you like, and for whatever goal you want. Writing plugins is generally quite easy; but your mileage may vary depending on what you are trying to achieve. A good place to start is examining the provide plugins and reading the \fIactions\fR command description, and the \fBENVIRONMENT\fR and \fBFILES\fR sections below.

 +-------------------+-------------------------------+

.TP
NOTE: The \fIfzfnav\fR plugin uses \fBfzf\fR(1) to navigate the file system and \fIBFG\fR (a script located in the plugins directory) to show previews (to show files preview \fIBFG\fR requires \fBueberzug\fR to be installed or the Kitty protocol via the Kitty terminal). A configuration file (BFG.cfg, in the plugins directory itlsef) is provided to customize the previewer's behavior. 
.TP
In addition to the built-in BFG previewer, \fIfzfnav\fR supports the use of both Ranger's \fIscope.sh\fR script and \fBpistol\fR. To use \fBscope\fR, just edit the \fIBFG\fR configuration file and set USE_SCOPE to 1 and SCOPE_FILE to the correct path of the \fIscope.sh\fR file (normally \fI$HOME/.config/ranger/scope.sh\fR). To use \fBpistol\fR instead, set USE_PISTOL to 1. 
.TP
NOTE 2: The \fIgit_status\fR plugin is not intended to be used as a normal plugin, that is, executed via an action name, but rather to be executed as a prompt command. Just add the path of the script to the \fBPROMPT COMMANDS\fR section in the configuration file:

 # PROMPT COMMANDS
 /usr/share/clifm/plugins/git_status.sh
.TP
Whereas this plugin provides basic Git integration, it could be easily modified (it is just a few lines long) to include whatever git function you might need.

.SH 16. STANDARD INPUT (STDIN)
CliFM is able to read and list paths from the input stream. Each path in the list should be an absolute path, terminated with a new line character (\\n) and stripped from extra characters not belonging to the path itself. The size of the input stream buffer is 262MiB (65536 paths, provided each path takes PATH_MAX bytes (4096 by default)).
.sp
Each file passed via standard input will be stored as a symbolic link pointing to the original file in a temporary directory (which will be deleted at program exit) and listed on startup. Bear in mind that the restore last path function is disabled when listing in this way. Examples:
.sp
 ls -Ad /var/* | clifm
.sp
This command will pass all files in /var to CliFM
.sp
If you need to perform more specific queries, you can use \fIfind\fR as follows:
.sp
 find \-maxdepth 1 \-size +500k \-print0 | tr '\\0' '\\n' | sed 's/\\.\\///g' | clifm
.sp
The above command will pass all files in the current directory bigger than 500KiB to CliFM.
.sp
You can also use stream redirection:
.sp
 ls -Ad $PWD/* > list.txt
 clifm < list.txt
.sp
All operations performed on these symbolic links (provided the current working directory is the temporary directory where all these files are stored) will be performed on the target files and NOT on the symbolic links themselves.

.SH 17. NOTE ON SPEED
CliFM is by itself quite fast by default, but if speed is still an issue, it is possible to get some extra performance.
.sp
The two most time consuming features are:

 \fB1)\fR The files counter, used to print the amount of files contained by listed directories. Disabling this option produces a nice performance boost.

 \fB2)\fR In default mode, \fBfstatat\fR(3) and \fBaccess\fR(3) are used to gather information about listed files. Since these functions, especially when executed hundreds (and even thousands) of times, are quite time consuming, the \fIlight mode\fR was implemented as an alternative listing process omitting all calls to them. When running in light mode, however, only basic file classification is performed, namely, that provided by the \fId_type\fR field of a dirent struct (see \fBreaddir\fR(3)). Bear in mind, nonetheless, that in case of a DT_UNKNOWN value, CliFM will fall back to \fBstat\fR(3) to get basic file classification: we might be facing a file system not returning the \fId_type\fR value, for example, loop devices.
.sp
Besides these two features, a few more things can be disabled to get some extra speed (though perhaps unnoticeable): icons (if enabled), columns, colors, and, if already running without colors, file type indicators. Because listing lots of files could be expensive and time consuming, you can also try to limit the amount of files printed for each visited directory (see the \fImf\fR command above).
.sp
Despite the above, however, it is important to bear in mind that listing speed does not only depend on the program's code and enabled features, but also on the terminal emulator used. Old, basic terminal emulators like Xterm, Aterm, and the kernel built-in console are really slow compared to more modern ones like Urxvt, Lxterminal, ST, and Terminator, to name just a few.

.SH 18. KANGAROO FRECENCY ALGORITHM
The directory jumper function is designed to learn the navigation habits of the user. The information is stored in a database (see the \fBFILES\fR section below) used to get the best match for a given string provided by the user. In this sense, Kangaroo is like a quick, smart, and evolved cd function.
.sp
The information stored in the database, always per directory, is:
 a) Number of visits
 b) Date of first visit (seconds since the Unix epoch)
 c) Date of the last visit
 d) The full path of each visited directory
.sp
With this information it is possible to construct a ranking of directories to offer the user the most accurate matches for each query string. The matching algorithm takes into account mainly two factors: frequency and recency (which is why this kind of algorithm is often called a \fBfrecency\fR algorithm).
.sp
After getting an initial list of matches based on the query string(s) entered by the user, the frequency algorithm is applied on each entry in the list. The algorithm is quite simple: \fB(visits * 100) / days-since-first-visit\fR. As a result, we get the average of visits per day since the day of the first visit (what we call the directory rank).
.sp
There are however some further steps in the ranking process: \fBBonus points\fR. 
.sp
Extra credits or penalties are assigned based on the directories \fBlast access time\fR according to the following simple algorithms:
 Within last hour:	rank * 4
 Within last day:	rank * 2
 Within last week:	rank / 2
 More than a week:	rank / 4
.sp
If the last query string matches the \fBbasename\fR of a directory, the entry for this directory has 300 extra credits. This is done simply because we normally use directory basenames as query strings: they are easier to remember.
.sp
In the same way, \fBpinned\fR directories get 1000 extra credits, \fBbookmarked directories\fR 500 credits, and directories currently in a \fBworkspace\fR 300 credits.
.sp
For example: if the query string is "test", /media/data/test will be matched. Now, if this directory was accessed within the last hour, and its rank was 200, it becomes 800. But, because the search string matches its basename, it gets 300 extra credits, and, if this directory is in addition bookmarked and pinned, it gets 1500 extra credits. In this way the total rank of this directory in the matching process is 2600. In doing this, we have more chances of matching what the user actually wanted to match.
.sp
Once all entries in the initial list of matches have been filtered via the above procedure and ranked, we can return the best ranked entry. The higher rank a directory has, the more priority it has over the remaining entries in the initial list of matches.
.sp
Automatic maintenance is done on the database applying a few simple procedures:

 a) Each entry in the database is checked at startup to remove non-existent directories.

 b) Once the rank of a directory falls below MinJumpRank (by default 10), it is forgotten and deleted from the database. The MinJumpRank value can be customized in the configuration file. To make non-frequently visited directories disappear quicker from the database, increase this value.

 c) Once the sum total of ranks reaches MaxJumpTotalRank (by default 100000), each individual rank is divided by a dynamic factor so that the total rank becomes less than or equal to MaxJumpTotalRank. If some rank falls in the process below MinJumpRank, it is removed from the database. MaxJumpTotalRank can be modified in the configuration file. The higher the value of MaxJumpTotalRank, the more time directories will be kept in the database.

NOTE: Directories visited in the last 24 hours will not be removed from the database, no matter what their rank is.
.sp
The idea of 'frecency' was, as far as I know, first devised and designed by Mozilla. See \fIhttps://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Mconnor/Past/PlacesFrecency\fR. However, it is also implemented, though using different algorithms, by different projects like \fBautojump\fR, \fBz.lua\fR, and \fBzoxide\fR.

.SH 19. ENVIRONMENT
The following variables are read at initialization time:
.TP
.B CLIFM_FILE_COLORS
A colon separated list of file type color codes in the same form specified above in the \fBCOLOR CODES\fR section
.TP
.B CLIFM_EXT_COLORS
Same as above, but for file extensions
.TP
.B CLIFM_IFACE_COLORS
Same as above, but for different element of ClIFM's interface
.TP
.B CLIFM_FILTER
Define a file filter. If set, this variable overrides the \fIFilter\fR option in the configuration file
.TP
Except when running in stealth mode, CliFM sets the following environment variables:
.TP
.B CLIFM
This variable is set to 1 to let other programs know they were spawned by CliFM
.TP
.B CLIFM_PROFILE
This variable is set to the current profile of CliFM (if using two or more instances of CliFM under different profiles, the last onw wil be used). Specially useful to develop CliFM plugins on a per profile basis.
.TP
.B CLIFM_SELFILE
The path to the current selection file.
.TP
.B CLIFM_BUS
This variable contains the path of a pipe by means of which plugins can talk to CliFM. Just write to the pipe and CliFM will hear and handle the message immediately after the plugin's execution. If the message is a path, CliFM will run the open function, changing the current directory to the new path, if a directory, or opening it with the resource opener, if a file. Otherwise, if the message is not a path, it will be taken and executed as a command. Examples:
.sp
\'echo "/tmp" > "$CLIFM_BUS"\' tells CliFM to change the current directory to /tmp
.sp
\'echo "s *.png" > "$CLIFM_BUS"\' makes CliFM select all files in the current directory ending with ".png"
.sp
The pipe (CLIFM_BUS) is deleted immediately after the execution of its content and recreated before running any other plugin.
.TP
If \fIPromptStyle\fR is set to "custom" in the configuration file, the following variables are exported to the environment to be used, if needed, by your custom prompt:
.TP
.B CLIFM_STAT_SEL
Current amount of selected files
.TP
.B CLIFM_STAT_TRASH
Current amount of trashed files
.TP
.B CLIFM_STAT_MSG
Current amount of system messages
.TP
.B CLIFM_STAT_WS
Current workspace number
.TP
.B CLIFM_STAT_EXIT
Exit code of the last executed command
.TP
.B CLIFM_STAT_ROOT
1 if user is root (UID = 0), 0 otherwise
.TP
.B CLIFM_STAT_STEALTH
1 if running in stealth mode, 0 otherwise

.SH 20. MISCELLANEOUS NOTES
.sp
\fBSequential and conditional execution of commands\fR:

For each of the internal commands (see the \fBCOMMANDS\fR section above) you can use the semicolon to execute them sequentially and/or the double ampersand to execute them conditionally. Example: 'cmd1; cmd2 && cmd3'. 
.sp
Though you can use here external commands as well, bear in mind that, whenever at least one internal command is involved in a chained list of commands, CliFM will take care of executing this list (simply because the system shell isn't able to understand any of these commands), so that no shell inter\-process function (like pipes), nor any stream redirection or shell expression (like IF blocks or FOR loops) will be available. However, the shell is still used to run single external commands found in the chained list, but in isolation from the remaining commands in this list.
.sp
As a rule of thumb, when using chained commands make sure to always expand ELN's to avoid undesired consequences. If, for instance, you issue this command: 'touch aaa && r 3', you will end up deleting a file you were not intended to delete, simple because after the successful execution of the first command, the ELN 3 corresponds now to a different file.
.sp

\fBExternal commands\fR:

CliFM is not limited to its own set of internal commands, like open, sel, trash, etc., but it can run any external command as well, provided external commands are allowed (see the \-x option, the 'ext' command, or the configuration file). By beginning the external command by a colon or a semicolon (':', ';') you tell CliFM not to parse the input string, but instead letting this task to the system shell. However, bear in mind that CliFM is not intended to be used as a shell, but as the file manager it is.
.sp

\fBTerminal emulators and non-ASCII characters\fR:

It depends on the terminal emulator you use to correctly display non\-ASCII characters and characters from the extended ASCII charset. If, for example, you create a file named "ñandú" (the Spanish word for 'rhea'), it will be correctly displayed by the Linux console, Lxterminal, and Urxvt, but not thus by Xterm or Aterm.
.sp

\fB.Xresources\fR:

CliFM will create \fI$HOME/.Xresources\fR, if it doesn't already exist, for keybindings to work correctly. However, some (and even all) of these keybindings might not work in some terminals, though they do work fine on the console (TTY), xvt\-like terminal emulators like Urxvt and Aterm, and xterm\-like ones. However, keybinding can be edited freely to make them work on any terminal emulator.
.sp

\fBSpaces and escape codes\fR:

When dealing with file names containing spaces, you can use both single and double quotes (ex: "this file" or 'this file') plus escape sequences (ex: this\\ file).
.sp

\fBStarting path\fR:

By default, CliFM starts in the current working directory. However, you can always specify a different path by passing it as positional parameter. Ex: clifm /home/user/misc. You can also permanently set up the starting path in the CliFM configuration file. If the RestoreLastPath option is set to true, CliFM will start instead in the last visited directory (and in the last used workspace), unless the starting path (and optionally the workspace number) is specified via command line.
.sp

\fBDefault profile\fR:

CliFM's default profile is "default". To create alternative profiles use the \-P command line option or the 'pf add' command (see above).

.SH 21. FILES
.TP
.B CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/clifmrc\fR. It will be copied from \fIDATADIR/clifm\fR (usually \fI/usr/share/clifm\fR), and if not found, it will be created anew with default values.
Here you can permanently set up CliFM options, add aliases and some prompt commands (which will be executed immediately before each new prompt line). Just recall that in order to use prompt commands you must allow the use of external commands. See the \-x option and the 'ext' command above.
.sp
A description for each option in the configuration file can be found in the configuration file itself.
.TP
.B PROFILE FILE
The profile file is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/profile.cfm\fR.
In this file you can add those commands you want to be executed at startup. You can also permanently set here some custom variables, ex: 'dir="/path/to/folder"'. This variable may be used as a shortcut to that folder, for instance: 'cd $dir'. Custom variables could also be temporarily defined via the command prompt: Ex: user@hostname ~ $ var="This is a test". Temporary variables will be removed at program exit.
.TP
.B KEYBINDINGS FILE
The keybindings file is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/keybindings,cfm\fR. It will be copied from \fIDATADIR/clifm\fR (usually \fI/usr/share/clifm\fR), and if not found, it will be created anew with default values. This file is used to specify the keyboard shortcuts used for some ClifM's functions. The format for each keybinding is always "keyseq:function", where 'keyseq' is an escape sequence in GNU emacs style. A more detailed explanation can be found in the keybindings file itself.
.TP
.B PLUGINS DIRECTORY
The directory used to store programs or scripts pointed to by actions (in other words, plugins) is \fIDATADIR/clifm/plugins\fR (usually \fI/usr/share/clifm/plugins\fR). To edit these plugins copy them to \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/plugins\fR and edit them to your liking. Plugins in this local directory take precedence over those in the system one.
.TP
.B COLORS DIRECTORY
This directory, \fI$DATADIR/clifm/colors\fR, contains available color schemes as files with a \fI.cfm\fR extension. You can create as many color schemes as you want by just dropping them in this directory. The default color scheme file (default.cfm) could be used as a guide. You can copy these color schemes to the local colors directory (\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/colors\fR) and edit them to your liking. Color schemes in the local colors directory take precedence over those in the system directory.
.TP
.B ACTIONS FILE
The file used to define custom actions is \fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clifm/profiles/PROFILE/actions.cfm\fR. It will be copied from \fIDATADIR/clifm\fR (usually \fI/usr/share/clifm\fR), and if not found, it will be created anew with default values.

\fBNOTE\fR: Always try TAB. TAB completion is available for many things

Get help:
\fBF1\fR: manpage
\fBF2\fR: keybindings
\fBF3\fR: commands

\fBn myfile mydir/\fR: Create a new file named 'myfile' and a new directory named 'mydir'. Since CliFM is integrated into the system shell, you can also use any of the shell commands you usually use to create new files. Ex: 'touch myfile' or 'nano myfile'

\fBmd DIR(s)\fR: Create new directories

\fB/etc\fR: Change directory to \fI/etc\fR

\fB5\fR: Change-to/open the directory/file in the current directory whose ELN is 5
.sp
TIP: Press TAB to make sure 5 is the file you want. If the suggestions system is enabled, just pay attention to the suggestion

\fBj xproj\fR: Jump to \fI~/media/data/docs/work/mike/xproject\fR:
.sp
NOTE: This depends however on the database ranking. For more accuracy: \fBj mike xproj\fR

\fBb\fR or \fBShift+left\fR or \fBAlt+j\fR: Go back to the directory you came from

NOTE: Enter \fBf\fR, or press \fBShift+right\fR or \fBAlt+k\fR to go back to the first directory

\fBAlt+l\fR: Change to detail/long view mode

\fBp4\fR: Print the properties of the file whose ELN is 4

\fBrf\fR: Reprint the list of files in the current directory

\fBs 1-4 8 19-26\fR: Select multiple files in the current directory by ELN

\fBsb\fR: List selected files

\fBds\fR: Deselect a few files

\fBmd mydir && mydir\fR: Create a directory named \fImydir\fR and cd into it

\fBm sel\fR: Move selected files into the current directory

.SH EXIT STATUS
CliFM returns the exit status of the last executed command:
.sp
\fB0\fR		Successful execution
.sp
\fB1\fR		Error

.SH CONFORMING TO
CliFM is C99 compliant, and, if compiled with the _BE_POSIX flag, it is POSIX.1-2008 compliant as well. If not, only two non-POSIX functions are used: \fBstatx\fR(2) (Linux specific), to get files birth time, and \fBstrverscmp\fR(3) (a GNU extension), to list files by version.
