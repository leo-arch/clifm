ColorScheme=default

# The amount of files contained by a directory is informed next
# to the directory name. However, this feature might slow things down when,
# for example, listing files on a remote server. The filescounter can be
# disabled here, via the --no-files-counter option, or using the 'fc'
# command while in the program itself.

# the prompt. DividingLineChar accepts both literal characters (in single
# quotes) and decimal numbers.

# history list, showing previous, current, and next entries
DirhistMap=false

# Use a regex expression to filter file names when listing files.
# Example: !.*~$ to exclude backup files (ending with ~), or ^\. to list 
# only hidden files. Do not quote the regular expression

# Set the default copy command. Available options are: 0 = cp,
# 1 = advcp, and 2 = wcp. Both 1 and 2 add a progress bar to cp.

# The prompt line is built using string literals and/or one or more of
# the following escape sequences:
# \xnn: The character whose hexadecimal code is nn.
# \e: Escape character
# \h: The hostname, up to the first dot
# \u: The username
# \H: The full hostname
# \n: A newline character
# \r: A carriage return
# \a: A bell character
# \d: The date, in abbrevieted form (ex: 'Tue May 26')
# \s: The name of the shell (everything after the last slash) currently used
# by CliFM
# \S: The number of the current workspace
# \l: Print an 'L' if running in light mode
# \P: Current profile name
# \t: The time, in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format
# \T: The time, in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format
# \@: The time, in 12-hour am/pm format
# \A: The time, in 24-hour HH:MM format
# \w: The full current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
# \W: The basename of $PWD, with $HOME abbreviated with a tilde
# \p: A mix of the two above, it abbreviates the current working directory 
# only if longer than PathMax (a value defined in the configuration file).
# \z: Exit code of the last executed command. :) if success and :( in case of
# error
# \$ '#', if the effective user ID is 0, and '$' otherwise
# \nnn: The character whose ASCII code is the octal value nnn
# \\: A backslash
# \[: Begin a sequence of non-printing characters. This is mostly used to
# add color to the prompt line
# \]: End a sequence of non-printing characters
