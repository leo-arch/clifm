# Lines starting with either '#' or ';' are commented out (ignored).

# Show hidden files (i.e., files starting with a dot).
# Supported values: true, false, first, last.
# If 'true', hidden files are sorted according to the value of the Sort
# option (see below).
;ShowHiddenFiles=false

# Files listed in a '.hidden' file in the current directory are hidden when
# when hidden files are not shown (i.e., when ShowHiddenFiles is set to false).
# Both plain filenames and wildcards are supported for specifying hidden files.
;ReadDotHidden=false

# Regular expression to filter files from the file list.
# For example: "!.*~$" to exclude backup files (ending with ~), or "^\." to
# list only hidden files. File type filters are also supported, such as
# "=d" to list directories only, or "!=l" to exclude symbolic links.
# Run 'help file-filters' for more information.
;Filter=""

# List directories before files.
;ListDirsFirst=true

# Display the number of files inside each directory next to the directory
# name. This feature may slow down performance when, for example, listing
# files on a remote server: the file counter can be disabled here, via
# the --no-file-counter option, or using the 'fc' command while in the
# program itself.
# Note: This option requires Classify (see below) to be set to true.
;FileCounter=true

# When colors are enabled, append directory indicator to directories. When
# colors are disabled (via the --no-color option), append file type
# indicator to filenames instead:
# '/' for directories
# '@' for symbolic links
# '=' for sockets
# '|' for FIFO/pipes
# '*' for for executable files
# '+' for block special files
# '-' for character special files
# '?' for unknown file types
# Bear in mind that when running in light mode the check for executable
# files is not performed, and thereby no indicator is added to executable
# files.
# Note: Disabling this option also disables the file counter.
;Classify=true

# Colorize symbolic links according to their target. A link indicator
