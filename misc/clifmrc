# Lines starting with either '#' or ';' are commented out (ignored).
# Options starting with a ';' hold the default value, but are commented out.
# To override a default value uncomment the corresponding option (remove

#          1. INTERFACE               #
#=====================================#

# Show hidden files (i.e. files starting with a dot).
# Supported values: true, false, first, last.
# If 'true', hidden files are sorted according to the value of the Sort
# option (see below).
;ShowHiddenFiles=false

# Files listed in a '.hidden' file in the current directory will be hidden
# when hidden files are not shown (i.e. when ShowHiddenFiles is set to false).
# Both plain filenames and wildcards are supported for specifying hidden files.
;ReadDotHidden=false

# Use a regular expression to filter files from the files list.
# For example: "!.*~$" to exclude backup files (ending with ~), or "^\." to
# list only hidden files. File type filters are also supported, such as
# "=d" to list directories only, or "!=l" to exclude symbolic links.
# Run 'help file-filters' for more information on how to use this feature.
;Filter=""

# List directories first.
;ListDirsFirst=true

# Display the number of files contained in each directory next to the
# directory name. This feature may slow down performance when, for example,
# listing files on a remote server. The file counter can be disabled here,
# via the --no-file-counter option, or using the 'fc' command while in the
# program itself.
# Note: This option requires Classify (see below) to be set to true.
;FileCounter=true

# When using colors, append directory indicator to directories. If colors
# are disabled (via the --no-color option), append file type indicator to
# filenames instead:
# '/' for directories
# '@' for symbolic links
# '=' for sockets
# '|' for FIFO/pipes
# '*' for for executable files
# '+' for block special files
# '-' for character special files
# '?' for unknown file types
# Bear in mind that when running in light mode the check for executable
# files will not be performed, and thereby no indicator will be added to
# executable files.
# Note: Disabling this option also disables the files counter.
;Classify=true

# Color symbolic links according to their target filename. An indicator
# character (by default '@') is placed at the beginning of the name to mark
# it as a symbolic link.
# The color of this indicator can be customized in the color scheme file
# (InterfaceColors field) via the 'lc' code.
;ColorLinksAsTarget=false

# Control the use of the file list pager. Supported values are:
# 0/false = Disable the pager.
# 1/true  = Run the pager whenever the list of files does not fit on the screen.
# >1      = Run the pager whenever the number of files in the current directory is
#           greater than or equal to this value (e.g., 1000).
;Pager=false

# Specify how to list files in the pager. Supported values:
# auto  = Use the current listing mode
# long  = List files in long view
# short = List files in short view
;PagerView=auto

# Choose how to list files: 0 = vertically (like ls), 1 = horizontally.
;ListingMode=0

# Determine the sort method for listed files.
# Supported values include: none, name, version, extension, type, blocks,
# size, links, atime, btime, ctime, mtime, inode, owner, and group.
;Sort=version

# By default, files are sorted in ascending order (e.g.: from 'a' to 'z' if
# using the "name" method). Set SortReverse to true to invert this ordering.
# You can also use the --sort-reverse option or the 'st rev' command to achieve
# the same effect.
;SortReverse=false

# Sort filenames starting with PrioritySortChar first.
# Multiple values are allowed (e.g. 'PrioritySortChar=._#')
# Leave empty to unset this option (no priority character).
# Supported values are ASCII characters from SPACE to TILDE.
# Tip: A common value for this option is underscore (_).
# Note: This option takes precedence over SkipNonAlnumPrefix (see below).
;PrioritySortChar=

# Display extended file metadata next to filenames (long listing format).
;LongViewMode=false

# Specify which properties to display for each filename in long view mode:
# f       = Files counter (for directories)
# B       = File allocated blocks
# d       = Inode number
# l       = Number of hard links
# p|n     = Permissions: either symbolic (p) or numeric/octal (n)
# i|I     = User/group IDs: either as number (i) or name (I)
# G       = If i|I is set, don't print groups
# a|b|m|c = Last (a)ccess, (b)irth, (m)odification, or status (c)hange time
# s|S     = Size (either human readable (s) or bytes (S))
# x       = Extended attributes/capabilities/ACLs (marked as '@')
#           (requires p|n)
#
# A single dash ("-") disables all fields.
#
# Note that, exception made of 'x' and 'G', fields will be displayed in the
# order specified here.
#
# Example: display only permissions (numeric) and size (human readable):
#PropFields="ns"
# or, to display file permissions, modification time, and size (in bytes):
#PropFields="pmS"
;PropFields="xfpIsm"

# Set the number of spaces between fields in long view. Possible values: 1 or 2.
;PropFieldsGap=1

# Choose the style for printing timestamps in long view mode.

# for older files.
# Examples:
;TimeStyle="full-iso"
;TimeStyle="relative"

# PropFields.
;TimeFollowsSort=true

# Append an indicator ('a', 'b', 'c', or 'm') to the timestamp in long view

# are used for better visibility.
;TimestampMark=false

# Similar to TimeStyle, but specifically for the 'p/pp' command.
# Supported values: default, iso, long-iso, full-iso, full-iso-nano, +FORMAT
# Nano-second precision is available via the %N modifier.
;PTimeStyle="+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%N %z"

# Display recursive directory sizes (long view only).
;FullDirSize=false

# Display apparent file sizes (logical size) instead of actual device
# usage (physical size).
;ApparentSize=true

# In light mode, extra file type checks are disabled to speed up the listing
# process. This means that checks for readability, executability, SUID, SGID,
# broken symlinks, etc., are not performed. The file extension check is also
# ignored, disabling the color per-extension feature.
;LightMode=false

# Clear the terminal screen before listing files.
# Supported values: true, false, internal (restrict this behavior to
# internal commands only: shell commands will not clear the screen).
# Note: If set to 'internal', the current list of files will not be refreshed

# current directory.
;ClearScreen=true

# Set the maximum filename length for listed files. If TruncateNames is enabled,

# if MaxFilenameLen is smaller than MinNameTruncate.
;MaxFilenameLen=20

# Truncate filenames longer than MaxFilenameLen.
;TruncateNames=true

# Minimum length at which a filename can be truncated in long view mode.

;MinNameTruncate=20

# A comma separated list of workspace names in the format NUM=NAME.
# Example: "1=MAIN,2=EXTRA,3=GIT" or "1=α,2=β,3=γ"

# list can become extensive, you can limit the number of printed
# entries using the MaxPrintSelfiles option below.
;PrintSelfiles=false

# Maximum number of selected files to be printed if PrinSelFiles is

;MaxPrintSelfiles=0

# Color schemes (or just themes) are stored in the colors directory
# ($XDG_DATA_DIRS/clifm/colors, usually /usr/local/share/clifm/colors

# Enable the use of icons in the file list.
# By default, emojis (widely available today) are used as icons, but

#=====================================#

# Set the quoting style used to expand ELNs (regular files only).

# Enable fuzzy matching for filename and path completions and suggestions.
;FuzzyMatching=false

# Choose the fuzzy matching algorithm to use. Supported values:
