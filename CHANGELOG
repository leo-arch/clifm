1.26 (Fettucini Bros) - Jul 21, 2025

BUG FIXES:
* No field printed after 'S' in long view.
* No prompt in case of F1-F3 failure.
* The 'stats' command does not count files with extended attributes.
* --secure-cmds: Only the first mime placeholder (%) is sanitized: in "CMD %f %u", "%u" won't be checked.
* 'p' command: no size in bytes when size is exactly 1k.
* 24bit SGR sequence with foreground, background, and underline color (kitty) not working.
* Accept first suggested word (Alt+f) fails with Unicode string.
* './<TAB>' lists only executable files and directories, even if auto-open is enabled.
* Though "w:" is a reserved keyword (for workspaces), filename validation (when creating new files) does not warn about it.
* "--sel-file=\\/" is interpreted as the current directory instead of the root dir.
* Cannot trash '~/trashdir2' if the trash directory is '~/trashdir'.
* Bad error message when a short option with a Unicode character is used. E.g.: 'clifm -รถ' complains "clifm: 'clifm': Unrecognized option", when it should be '-รถ'.
* 'view edit' does not open the alternative shotgun file, but the default one.
* 'mm info' ignores alternative shotgun file.
* 'mm info' refuses to run on privileged files.
* Double screen refresh after running a keybinding.
* 'ow' does not support %m and %u placeholders.

IMPROVEMENTS:
* The 'icons' command toggles icons when used without parameters.
* Harden alternative config dirs/files checks: avoid using non-dirs/reg_files respectively.
* Better autodetect tab completion mode: use any of fzf, fnf, or smenu if the appropriate binary is found in PATH (and not specified otherwise in the command line or in the configuration file).
* Allow tab completion for ELNs in the bookmarks screen.

MISC:
* Lots of code cleaning and improvements.

1.25 (Scumm Bar) - May 3, 2025

BUG FIXES:
* 'kb': Some escape sequences are not properly translated (e.g. '\e[200~' for 'bracketed-paste-begin').
* Create a file (n file) and then remove it (r file). Press Alt+n and then Enter: a file named "n" is created! The same happens with 'le' and 'm' (interactive rename) when pressing Enter on empty line.
* Some legacy terminals (like the FreeBSD console) froze as soon as we try to query some data from it.
* 'kb bind' does not allow to switch keybindings (for example, setting F1 for bookmarks and Alt+b for show-manpage).
* 'Alt+h' runs a wrong command name ('bh').
* 'Ctrl+Alt+t' attempts to trash a file named 'sel' when there are no selected files.
* The 'extension' sort method takes hidden files as file extensions.
* No Tab completion for the 'hidden' command.
* '--disk-usage': No device name when running on Termux (Android).
* Positional parameter: cannot open file URI encoded directory names.
* Positional parameter: If file contains references to self or parent dir ('.' or '..'), the path is not properly resolved.
* '--data-dir' rejects '/usr/share/clifm', even when this is the actual data directory.
* the '=g' filter skips some files with the SGID bit set.
* Compilation error on MacOS Leopard (10.5).
* The 'j' command fails to change directory with escaped directory names.

NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS:
* Add support for the kitty keyboard protocol. Use the --kitty-keys command line flag to ask the terminal to enable this protocol. Consult the manpage for more information.
* Add support for styled underlines. See https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/underlines/#colored-and-styled-underlines
* Add support for the Kitty Notifications Protocol (https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/desktop-notifications/). Enable via '--desktop-notifications=kitty' in the command line or 'DesktopNotifications=kitty' in the configuration file.
* If running in vi editing mode, print "(ins)" or "(cmd)" (for insert and command modes respectively) at  the left of the prompt. Use the '\v' prompt escape code to handle this notification manually.
* New bindable action: 'toggle-vi-mode' (bound by default to Ctrl+Alt+j). Update your 'readline.clifm' and 'keybindings.clifm' files.
* Force the use of a specific color palette via $CLIFM_FORCE_COLOR (supported values: 8, 16, 256, truecolor or 24bit).
* Improve 'kb bind' function (more sensible prompts and better overall flow).
* Allow setting multiple keybindings for the same action. 'show-manpage2', for example, is not required anymore: just define an extra keybinding for 'show-manpage'.
* Better organization for the keybindings file (update your keybindings file).
* '--show-hidden','-a' now take 'true', 'first', 'last', and 'false' as optional parameters (if no parameter is given, 'true' is assumed).
* Add 'first' and 'last' parameters to the 'hh'/'hidden' command.
* New prompt escape codes: \Q (number of regular and special files); \g (current sort order), \j (octal permissions of the current directory).
* New prompt ('counter'), using the above new prompt codes.
* Image preview support for iTerm2. Set $method to 'iterm' in the clifmimg script to force the use of this protocol. Update your clifmimg script.
* Allow the use of multiple positional parameters. For example, 'clifm /etc ~/Downloads' will start clifm in the '/etc' directory (first workspace), setting the second workspace to '~/Downloads'.
* Consistent format for setting messages (on/off).
* Make bulk rename work with 'vis' and 'helix' text editors: 'br' was complainig about the tmp file having changed on disk due to how these editors save files by default (via rename(2)).

MISC:
* '--no-apparent-size' is deprecated. Use '--physical-size' instead.
* '--no-files-counter' is deprecated. Use '--no-file-counter' instead.
* 'undel' command is deprecated. Use 'u/untrash' instead.
* 'splash' command removed.

1.24 (Toothrot) - Mar 2, 2025

BUG FIXES
* File extension conflicts in 'default' color scheme (16-color version).
* Wrongly sorting Unicode file names ('name' and 'version' sort).
* When sorting by 'extension', 'CaseSensitiveList=true' is ignored.
* The value of 'PagerView' is ignored when 'Pager' is set to a value >=1.
* Pressing 'c' while in the pager stops listing (like 'q').
* Running plain 'pg' overwrites the value of 'Pager' in the configuration file.
* When mounting a FS via 'net mount', autocommands for this directory are not immediately executed.
* The 'ad' command complains that '.rpm' and '.deb' files are not archive/compressed files.
* 'name' sort behaves like 'version' when file names start with numbers.
* Not properly clearing the screen on Eterm terminal.
* Wrong image size when previewing images on the Ghostty terminal.
* The profiles function is broken (no config file change, system messages are not reset).
* Wrong file color when TAB completing globs after a path (e.g. dir/*.jpg<TAB>).
* When there's only one profile Ctrl-Alt-p clears the screen and still attempts to the change the profile.
* If we have no access to the main configuration directory, the selections file is created in '/tmp' instead of '/tmp/clifm_$USER'.
* If we have no access to the main configuration directory, selected files are not written to the selections file.
* TAB completion: Matches not sorted alphabetically in FZF (e.g. ls --<TAB>). Update your color scheme files.
* Wrongly identifying extension conflicts when running with '--lscolors'.
* '/dir/GLOB<TAB>' (e.g. '/bin/p*<TAB>') do not generate previews whenever it is the first word.
* The 't' command informs a wrong size for the trash directory.
* No lock icon for non-regular files.
* A few wrong colors when any of 'xs' and/or 'xf' color codes are unset (affects old color schemes).
* Kilobyte written as 'KB' instead of 'kB' when using decimal sizes ('--si').
* Ctrl-Alt-b does nothing (points to non-existent function). Removed.
* Cannot rebind 'bookmarks' to 'Alt-b': clifm complains that this key conflicts with readline and refuses to continue.
* Unsetting a keybinding via 'kb bind' does not work.

NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS
* clifmimg: Drastically reduce the size of postscript thumbnails (1500%!). Update your 'clifmimg' script.
* Preview: add support for several image formats (dpx, jp2, miff, sgi, and wmf among others). Please update your 'preview.clifm' file.
* 'mimelist.clifm' and 'preview.clifm' config files: The '%m' placeholder expands to the file's MIME type.

* Two new values added to the 'ShowHiddenFiles' option: 'first' and 'last', to list hidden files first or last.
* Manually map file extensions to MIME types using the '~/.mime.types' file. Consult the manpage for more information.
* Allow setting multiple chars in 'PrioritySortChar' option.
* Report the current directory to the underlying terminal (via the OSC-7 escape sequence). To enable, run with '--report-cwd'.
* Try harder to create a valid temporary directory (mostly in case of denied access to the directory).
* If '--lscolors' (using FreeBSD LSCOLORS), read extension colors from the color scheme file.
* Improve 'kb' command: attempt to display human-readable key presses (e.g. Shift-Up) instead of raw escape sequences (e.g. "\e[1;2A").

MISC
* $CLIFMRC cannot be used anymore to set the path to the main configuration file (use '-c,--config-file' instead).
* If 'nf' color code (unaccesible file) isn't set, use whatever color corresponds to the current file type and prepend and exclamation mark to the corresponding entry in the files list to mark it as unaccessible. Same for 'nd' (unaccessible directory).
* --no-trim-names, TrimNames, and MinFilenameTrim were renamed to --no-truncate-names, TruncateNames, and MinNameTruncate respectively (old names are deprecated).
* 'open-sel', 'untrash-all', and 'move-sel' keybindings are unset by default.
* 'copy-sel' can be used as an alias for 'paste-sel' in keybindings.

1.23 (Piranha poodle) - Jan 20, 2025

BUG FIXES
* TAB completion: file names with embedded control chars are not properly colorized.
* TAB completion: no preview for file names with embedded control chars.
* Image previews: 'img2txt' method not working for ANSI images ('clifmimg').
* 'view' command not working when running with '--stdtab'.
* 'cl,columns' command stopped working.
* 'sel *.pdf' works, but 'desel *.pdf' doesn't.
* Opening applications using the '%x' flag (mimelist file) not working with '--secure-cmds'.
* 'MaxFilenameLen=-1' (in the config file) is ignored.
* Garbage on the command line running a keybinding in vi-mode. 
* Wrong image placement (ueberzug method) when '--height' is set from either $FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS or 'FzfTabOptions'.
* Config: 'cmCmd=5' (rsync) does not copy directories themselves (but its content).
* Cannot operate on file names containing REGEX characters (e.g. the command 's c++' REGEX expands 'c++').
* --preview/--open fail when given a file URI with percent-escaped characters (e.g. 'file:///home/user/this%20file.txt').
* Cannot open file with single quote in name (e.g. "John's file.txt").

NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS
* Add file preview for javascript files.
* Image previews: add support for exr, fit, hdr, heic, pbm, pgm, pnm, ppm, and xpm image formats.
* Properly fail when '--opener' is given no parameter.
* 'x' command: expand environment variable in TerminalCmd (first word only).
* 'x' command: run terminal detached (via setsid(3)). 
* 'X' command: do not run with 'sudo' if already root.
* Set the main configuration file path via $CLIFMRC.
* Add '--help' to the 'reload' command.
* 'config reload' can be used now instead of 'reload'.
* Add '--mimelist-file' command line option to set an alternative mimelist file.
* Check for file existence when setting alternative configuration files.
* New prompt module (m_hostname_color): dinamically colorize the hostname depending on whether we're on a SSH session or not.
* Adjust the number of spaces between icons and file names using the 'IconsGap' option in the configuration file. Valid values: 0, 1 (default), or 2.
* Explicitly check $XDG_DATA_HOME and $XDG_DATA_DIRS when setting clifm's data directory.
* Add builtin confirmation prompt to 'c' and 'm' commands.
* Set a default answer for confirmation prompts via 'DefaultAnswer' in the config file (default value: "o:n,r:n,t:y,R:n,d:y"). This means: "no" for overwrite (includes 'c' and 'm' commands), remove, and bulk rename, "yes" for everything else (including trash).
* Create files from templates using the 'n' command. Run 'n --help' for more information.
* 'p/pp' command: print both apparent and physical sizes.
* Make '--lscolors' able to understand $LSCOLORS (FreeBSD style).
* Purge the thumbnails directory of dangling thumbnails using the 'view purge' command. Remember to update your 'clifmimg' script to start populating the thumbnails database: 'cp /usr/share/clifm/plugins/clifmimg ~/.config/clifm/'. Note that the thumbnails directory has been changed from '$XDG_CACHE_HOME/clifm/previews' to '$XDG_CACHE_HOME/clifm/thumbnails'. You can remove the old directory: from now on thumbnails will be stored in the new directory.
* Both the mimelist and the preview configuration files now support the '%u' placeholder, which is expanded to the file URI for the original file name.
* 'clifmimg': Generate thumbnail names as MD5 hashes of the file URI for the original file name (as recommended by the FreeDesktop specification - https://specifications.freedesktop.org/thumbnail-spec/latest/thumbsave.html), instead of hashing the file itself. This brings a nice performance improvement, specially when it comes to large files. This works along with the '%u' placeholder mentioned above. Update your 'clifmimg' script.
* Prevent big files from generating a preview via 'PreviewMaxSize' in the config file. Supported size units: K, M, G, T; supported size range: 1K-2047G. E.g.: "PreviewMaxSize=100M".
* Colorize .csv files as documents (default color scheme).
* Colorize .sass and .scss files as markup files (default color scheme).
* Sort completion matches for mimetype filter (@<TAB>).
* Add previewing app info to 'mm info' command.

* Help messages ignore the command line text color.
* The 'n/new' command issues a warning when attempting to create a file in the home directory using the tilde ('~/FILE').
* File previews (TAB completion or the 'view' command) ignore alternative preview file (set via either '--shotgun-file', '--config-dir', or '--profile').
* 'rr' does not work with directory names containing spaces (e.g. 'rr this\ dir').
* The 'open/preview' function matches directories as valid opening applications.

NEW FEATURES/IMPROVEMENTS
* Extra file type filters for the '=' keyword: 'D' for empty directories, 'F' for empty regular files, and 'L' for broken links. On Solaris, the 'D' file type char (previously used for door files) was replaced by 'O'.
* Use the 'kb bind' command to customize your key bindings instead of manually editing the keybindings file (via 'kb edit').
* 'kb conflict' now checks for readline key bindings as well.
* Proper error messages when appliaction does not exist/fails while previewing images (clifmimg).
* Add image previewing method for mobi files (clifmimg).

* Automatic detection of image preview method. Update your clifmimg script (~/.config/clifm/clifmimg) (just remove it and restart) to make use of this new feature. By default, Clifm and the 'clifmimg' script will try to guess the best previewing method (sixel, ueberzug, kitty, or ansi). Edit the 'method' variable in the 'clifmimg' script to manually set a previewing method.
* A more modern interface: If Unicode support is detected, Clifm will draw decorations using Unicode characters (use '--no-unicode' to disable Unicode decorations, and '--unicode' to force it).
* The selected files indicator in the prompt was replaced by 'S' (previously '*').
* Right pad and colorize ELN's in dirhist map.
* The color scheme is checked at startup for file extension conflicts. If found, the user is warned.

* New config file option: 'InformAutocmd' to control how matching autocommands are displayed in the prompt. Available values: 'none', 'short', 'long', 'full', and 'prompt' (default).
* Better columns arrangement when listing files (vertical list only).
* Lira: make opening applications invoked with the '%x' flag run in a new session (detached from the terminal) (via setsid(3)).
* Lira: Check for 'Calligra' and 'Gnumeric' when opening office documents.
* Add 'N file(s) copied/moved' message to 'c' and 'm' commands.
* Set 'TrashForce' to false by default.
* Do not print the list of removed/trashed files after files removal/trash.
* Enable file system type and mountpoint (via '--disk-usage') on Cygwin/MSYS2/Solaris.

BREAKING CHANGES:
* Since 1) it was unintuitive to have '-a' and '-l' to **disable** hidden files and long view respectively (instead of enabling them, like most files listers do (ex: ls, exa, eza, lsd)), and 2) we were using uppercase options sometimes to enable and sometimes to disable features (which is not consistent), we made the following changes:
 * -a enables hidden files and -A disables it
 * -f enables dirs-first and -F disables it
 * -l enables long-view
 * -L like ls(1) -L option (long form: --follow-symlinks-long)
 * -o enables autocd and -O disables it
